      "Appearance": "Goku and Vegeta's height difference.\n\nVegeta is a well-built man of below-average stature, standing at 164 centimeters tall. His hair is black and spikes upwards with a prominent widow's peak . Like most Saiyans , he possesses defined eyes with a consistently stern look to them. Like other Universe 7 Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile, brown-furred tail , until it was permanently cut off by Yajirobe .\n\nOver the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing very short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner, Nappa , he later seems to be somewhat taller and noticeably more muscular. His hair becomes shorter and his forehead becomes smaller and his facial features, which are perpetually in a scowl (in contrast to before he lost his first fight with Goku, when he smiled most of the time), also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series progresses, making him look much older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in his debut.\n\n[ -Vegeta as a Frieza Force combatant\n-Vegeta in Resurrection ‘F’\n-Vegeta in casual clothing\n-Vegeta in the Prison Planet Saga\n-Vegeta's new blue armor ]\n1/5\n\nA major characteristic of Vegeta's is the fact that he is one of the only Saiyans who have continued to don the traditional Saiyan armor in combat. This armor became more and more minimalistic over the years, mirroring Vegeta's development from a cold-blooded conqueror to a defender of Earth. During most of Vegeta's adult life working under the Frieza Force , as well as his appearance in the Saiyan Saga , he wore white armor with yellow plates that has thin black lines over the stomach and lower back, plus rounded shoulder, hip, and crotch guards, that also possessed yellow plates with thin black lines. Underneath his armor, he also wore a blue jumpsuit, white gloves, and white boots. He would often wrap his tail around his armor in a belt-like fashion, and usually wore a red scouter (green in the manga) over his left eye. After the Saiyan Saga and during the Namek Saga , he wore a similar outfit to what he wore previously, but without hip or crotch guards. While wearing this outfit, he also no longer possessed his Saiyan tail, due to having it permanently cut by Yajirobe during his battle against the Dragon Team on Earth in the Saiyan Saga. He briefly wore another scouter, until deeming it unnecessary and destroying it. When his armor and bodysuit were damaged in his battle against Recoome , he replaced his outfit with an older model design, where he wears a navy-blue crew neck bodysuit underneath a white armor with thin lined brown stomach and lower back plates, but with simple white shoulder straps instead of full shoulder guards. He also wore a new pair of his white gloves and boots from his previous ones, after also being damaged. He collectively wore this outfit during the Captain Ginyu and Frieza Sagas respectively. In the Trunks Saga , he wore a loose-fitting pink short sleeved button-up shirt with the sign \"Bad Man\" at the back, a white tank top, yellow pants and green shoes with a brown trim. During the Androids/Cell Saga , he wore a similar outfit to what he wore in the Namek Saga, but wore an updated version of his armor and bodysuit, where his armor now has yellow shoulder straps instead of shoulder guards, and the armor plates taking on rectangular like shapes instead of semi-ovular ones, meanwhile, his bodysuit now extends to cover the lower half of his neck. From the Perfect Cell Saga and onwards, Vegeta now regularly wears an updated version of his white boots, where it has yellow striped tips. During the Buu Saga , to be allowed to fight in the World Martial Arts Tournament , Vegeta sported a sleeveless dark blue tank top tucked into matching sweatpants along with white gloves and boots. He later wore a similar outfit in Dragon Ball Super: Broly and Super Hero but with the color being more of a dark teal blue, and his boots being rounder and having gray soles at the bottom.\n\nDuring his early cameo, debut, and filler appearances in the Dragon Ball Z anime, Vegeta originally appeared with a totally different color scheme from his usual one, being depicted with reddish-brown hair, a light green and orange armor with guard plates, a navy-blue jumpsuit, orange gloves and dark brown boots with orange uppers. This occurred only in the anime, as at the time Vegeta was introduced in the anime, the Dragon Ball manga had not yet officially released a full colored Vegeta for the animators to take reference on when adapting Vegeta into the anime, so Toei Animation guessed his colors. It's not until the anime's depiction of Vegeta in his first arrival on Earth, that his color scheme completely changes to become more consistent to his traditional look, once the manga eventually revealed his actual color scheme. This color scheme also appears as an alternate color for his Battle Armor in various video games.\n\nIn his initial design as a child in Bardock - The Father of Goku , Vegeta was depicted with bangs but still maintained his traditional spiky hairstyle. He wore white and yellow RIT modeled Battle Armor with a red cape and the Saiyan Royal family crest over the left chest while also wearing a dark blue sleeveless tanktop and matching sweatpants underneath the armor and also wearing white gloves and white boots. During flashbacks of him as a child in Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super , Vegeta was constantly shown in this design. However, in his depiction as a child in the Dragon Ball Minus manga chapter, as well as Broly , which adapted parts of the Dragon Ball Minus manga chapter, Vegeta in his childhood is instead seen with his traditional hairstyle that has a widow's peak, instead of bangs. This is to keep it consistent with his prior statement in the Perfect Cell Saga that \"a pure-blooded Saiyans hair does not change from the day they are born\", as Toriyama had established this concept after the release of the Bardock - The Father of Goku special, which depicted Vegeta as a child with spiky hair and bangs, rather than his usual spiky hairstyle with a widow's peak. Also in this design, he wears a similar armor to the one he wore in his original design as a child, but with the armor being black instead of white which lacks the Saiyan Royal family crest, having a full-sleeved blue jumpsuit, and his boots appearing rounder, with yellow lined tips and gray soles. In a flashback of him as a child in Battle of Gods , Vegeta is shown with his widow's peak, but wears the same outfit he wore in his original design as a child in Bardock - The Father of Goku , although in this depiction of him, his undersuit now extends to cover the lower half of his neck, unlike in the original design. In all designs of Vegeta as a child, Vegeta would often let his tail hang loose, instead of wrapping it, like he did in his adulthood.\n\nIn Dragon Ball GT , Vegeta swaps out his outfit in favor of clothing more characteristic to an Earthling, wearing a dark blue collared leather vest, a dark red tank top, dark blue leather pants, a lavender belt with a gold buckle, lavender fingerless gloves, and lavender boots with a yellow toe cap and heel and a gold ring around the ankle. He also cropped his hair, which still spikes upward, and grew a mustache (albeit temporarily, as he immediately shaves it off after Bulla mocks him for it).\n\nIn Dragon Ball Super , Vegeta returns to wearing the same outfit he wore in the Androids/Cell Sagas, during the God of Destruction Beerus Saga . This becomes his most regularly worn outfit throughout most of Super . During the early part of his training under Whis , Vegeta wore a new outfit made by Bulma, which changes to have a grey jumpsuit with lines down the middle of the top half that split off at the waist, a sleeker version of his usual white and yellow armor with flatter shoulder straps, along with white gloves and boots with a few outlines. Whis also placed his insignia on the left side of the armor's chest without Vegeta noticing when they were training. Vegeta also donned this outfit during the Golden Frieza and Universe 6 Sagas . After the Universe 6 Saga, Vegeta again returns to wearing the same outfit he wore in the Androids/Cell Saga. In Broly , Vegeta switches to a slight variation of his regular outfit, with a darker blue jumpsuit, light gray panels on his armor instead of white, and more rounded boots with gray soles. To compensate for the Ice Continent 's cold weather, Vegeta wears a light green winter jacket, on top of his outfit, that has a high turtleneck, a long white line on each sleeve of the jacket, and a bold violet \"SAB\" sign in the left chest of the jacket. In the brief Dragon Ball Super manga recap version of the Broly events, Vegeta wears his regular outfit. In the Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga , while working as a temporary member of the Galactic Patrol , Vegeta receives the Galactic Patrol emblem in the left chest plate of his armor, while donning his regularly worn outfit. He also wears the traditional Yardrat outfit while training on Planet Yardrat . Under Beerus' tutelage and Energy of Destruction training in the Granolah the Survivor Saga , Vegeta returns to his familiar look and wears a golden earpiece on his left ear, just like the Destroyer, as a symbol that he can use Energy of Destruction.\n\nIn Super Dragon Ball Heroes , when he appears in the Prison Planet Saga , Vegeta is back to wearing the outfit he wore during Resurrection ‘F’ and the Universe 6 Saga , but with the armor having a Capsule Corp logo in place of Whis' symbol. The armor also has small white hip guards and no lines going across the stomach plate. In the Big Bang Mission, his bodysuit changes to bright blue.",
      "Personality": "{\" There's no planet to protect. No people to save. Just me, immersed in battle. My happy place. Just the thing to get a battle-crazed Saiyan 's blood pumping . \" — Vegeta in \" Vegeta Vs. Granolah \"}\n\nVegeta is arrogant throughout the series and becomes bitter due to the abuse his race suffered at the hands of Frieza , as well as his injured pride due to repeatedly falling short compared to another Saiyan. Following the destruction of his homeworld Planet Vegeta , his hatred toward Frieza grows. His royalty seems to have bestowed upon him an inflated sense of superiority, holding himself above nearly everyone he encounters. He is immensely proud of his Saiyan heritage and believes his race to be the most powerful in the universe . Despite this, even as an antagonist, he did not act as an ordinary Saiyan, being even crueler and prideful thanks to Frieza's influence. His determination to be the strongest remained ever-present even after his change of heart, remaining obsessed with the goal of surpassing Goku, as well as proving that he is stronger than any mortal, such as when he began to pit himself against Jiren , Universe 11 's strongest warrior, in order to prove this point, becoming more determined each time Jiren left him in the dust, even telling him that his arrogance was what defined him.\n\nAs the prince of a demolished Planet Vegeta, Vegeta is initially introduced as an unrepentant villain. Judging from his evil intentions before joining the Z Fighters , Vegeta has been consistently characterized as extremely arrogant, vengeful, and at times, sadistic. Many of Vegeta's early heroic acts are because of self-interest or revenge, although he later settles down and mellows out, adjusting to Earth as his home, raising a family with Bulma . Having been born into the upper tier of Saiyan society, Vegeta was fixated on achieving the legendary status of Super Saiyan and becoming the most powerful warrior in the universe. Vegeta is more of a tactical fighter who often rushes in the brawl without hesitation. However, his rage or arrogance often causes him to underestimate his opponent and usually leads to his eventual defeat and sometimes death. His royal blood and intense fighting style have both benefited and harmed him in many battles.\n\nVegeta has also been shown to be one of the more intelligent characters of the series, as well as one of the most serious, rarely exhibiting humor. When he does so, his humor is often very dry and far darker than his fellow Z Fighters. However, he does delight in mocking his enemies, as demonstrated when he offers to reconstruct Android 18 into a \"toaster\" or a \"washing machine\" ( Funimation dub only). He also shows his bleak sense of humor towards Goku when he was about to battle him in the World Martial Arts Tournament . Aside from his bleaker sense of humor, he has also at times engaged in more sarcastic humor when gloating. A notable example of this was when fighting Semi-Perfect Cell . When Cell demanded to know how Vegeta was as strong as he was, Vegeta flippantly stated that he got that strong by \"doing lots of push-ups and sit-ups, and [drinking] plenty of juice\", as well as calling Kid Buu a \"gifted speaker\" when the latter barely responded at all just before the latter destroyed the Earth. Normally, his massive ego and arrogance overshadow his positive qualities.\n\nDespite his personality flaws, Vegeta is capable of respecting individuals, although he never outright states it often showing his respect nonverbally. By the Majin Buu Saga , it is heavily implied that he and Piccolo were on civil terms and seemed to have mutual respect for one another. He also expressed some grief over Gohan 's fate at the hands of Buu himself. Outside of these two instances, his relationship with the rest of the Dragon Team seemed cool at best.\n\nInitially, Vegeta was extremely aggressive and cold-blooded. Since his childhood, Vegeta had proven himself to be a ruthless killer, merciless like most Saiyans. During the Namek Saga , however, he began to exhibit changes; rather than killing Krillin or Gohan as he promised in the previous saga , he instead forges an alliance with them. Throughout the first half of the Frieza Saga , whomever he defeated, he killed without mercy. His first sign of mercy was sparing Krillin and Bulma's lives in exchange for the Namekian Dragon Ball they were carrying when he could have easily killed them and taken it. Another sign of mercy came when he encounters Gohan a short time later and knees him in the stomach instead of killing him, and again when he let Namekian Frog Captain Ginyu live, taking delight at the notion of Ginyu's being stuck in the frog's body as punishment enough and not wanting to get frog guts all over his boots. After his defeat at the hands of Frieza, Vegeta tearfully explains to Goku that Frieza forced him to be ruthless and that he never had the chance to be anything else (implying that he could have been kinder and more merciful were it not for Frieza). He used to have egocentric, condescending views towards races of what he believed inferior or not of a warrior class or whatever he had little use for, considered physical and emotional attachments to be meaningless, and admittedly had little care or use for children, though he would at times acknowledge Gohan's impressive power during the boy's childhood. However, all these changes when he falls in love with Bulma and she bears him two half-Saiyan children. After settling on Earth , Vegeta softened up and began to exhibit compassion for his family. As a result of his love for Bulma and the birth of his children, Vegeta started to feel content settling down with a loving family while being a competitive warrior. However, Vegeta secretly felt ashamed for sacrificing his goal of becoming the strongest warrior in the universe for the sake of his family and came to believe it was his attachment to them and the planet that rendered him weak compared to Goku, though he kept those thoughts hidden for a time. On a similar note, largely because of his more cold-blooded and aggression, he initially had very little interest in avenging his race even after being made aware of rumors of Frieza having blown up their planet , even going as far as to say they deserved it due to being too weak, which notably shocked Nappa and Raditz when he admitted it. Even after receiving confirmation via Dodoria about Frieza's involvement in the genocide, his main motivation in avenging himself against Frieza afterward was less the Saiyan genocide itself and more being placed under forced servitude by Frieza for most of his life as a result. He seemed to have changed his tune later in life, as when confronting a revived Frieza, he makes clear that Frieza's genocide against his race is a major factor in why he refuses to rejoin him, and notably proceeded to attack Beerus in a rage after the latter admitted his role in causing the genocide to happen in the first place.\n\nIt was not until the Majin Buu Saga that Vegeta began to act upon his concealed feelings, first sparked by hearing of Goku's temporary return to the living world. His obsession with overtaking and defeating Goku was once again ignited, but the repeated setbacks during the World Tournament by Shin and Babidi 's conflict made him irritated that his fight was being unceremoniously postponed. In addition, upon witnessing Goku's Super Saiyan 2 during his fight against Yakon , Vegeta's hopes were further dashed as he realized how useless his own tireless training was. Desperation eventually consumes him to the point where he willingly allows Babidi to transform him into a Majin , claiming it is a return of his old \"evil\" self, though this was a desperate, failed ploy to restore his former wickedness, believing it to have been the source of his true power. Goku believes Vegeta is bluffing, and correctly so; Vegeta demonstrates his prevailing softness in hugging Trunks for the first time and telling him that he is proud to be his father, before performing a sacrificial Final Explosion against Majin Buu. It is when his family falls victim to Majin Buu that Vegeta finally understands the pain of losing a loved one and fully grasps the harm he has caused to so many people, and he comes to regret his many transgressions. Since then, he has refrained from killing his opponents unless necessary and tries to be cautious of situations.\n\n{\" But that's the thrill... don't you wanna see this power he keeps talking about? \" — Vegeta to his son about not letting Cell achieve his perfect form in \" The Last Defense \".}\n\nMajin Vegeta\n\nFrom the beginning of the series to near the end, Vegeta is shown to be exceptionally vain and egotistical. A prime example of this is in his fight with Semi-Perfect Cell. Though he could have easily destroyed this weaker form of Cell, his arrogance bested him, and he purposely let Cell absorb Android 18 just to have a challenge in Cell through which to test his power. However, it should be noted that Cell used trickery and had knowledge of Saiyans due to their cells composing his structure. While fighting Super Buu , as well as while fighting Janemba on a different occasion, Vegeta vehemently opposed fusion with Goku due to his pride, but Goku managed to persuade him. Later, Vegeta becomes more willing to fuse, going so far as to propose it himself in the battle against Omega Shenron in Dragon Ball GT . On several occasions, Vegeta conceitedly underestimates his opponents; in the cases of Perfect Cell and Kid Buu, Vegeta was fooled by their diminutive appearances, believing that they had only \"shrunk\", which is somewhat ironic, given his own short stature, yet large power. While Vegeta lives for battling powerful foes, in some instances he has been seen too afraid of opponents for their tremendous power; such as the Legendary Super Saiyan Broly , the God of Destruction Beerus (he does everything he possibly can to ensure that the God of Destruction is not angered when the latter arrives at Bulma's birthday party), and Frieza. However, against Broly and Beerus he visibly had a change of heart, displayed his pride, and took to the fight. Despite his lust for fighting against powerful foes, Vegeta's arrogance has a flipside too. It's debatable that stronger the foe, the more aggressive Vegeta's fighting style becomes and vice versa. He often recklessly throws himself into the fray against foes that are drastically more powerful than he is, while he barely bothers to touch significantly weaker enemies like Pui Pui for example. It could be argued that this attitude is a Saiyan trait instead of a personal quirk of his since there have been occasions when Goku shares this mentality, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent. Where Goku might see a potential learning experience in sparring with a weaker foe while keeping his own power level down to make it fair, it's likely that Vegeta refuses to dirty his hands with such menial tasks altogether.\n\n{\" The boy doesn't mean any harm, Zarbon . He just hasn't learned how to control his passion. Give him the hardest assignment that you have, and Vegeta... do come back alive. \" — Frieza when responding the young Vegeta's plea for another combat assignment in Dragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku .}\n\nVegeta along with Raditz and Nappa, after conquering Planet Shikk\n\nArguably, his most defining trait is his rivalry with Goku and his obsession to surpass him in power. In Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn , he goes so far as to break down in tears over his inability to surpass Goku. However, this obsession has led him to save Goku's life on several occasions, insisting that only he will defeat Goku. When Goku sacrifices himself to save the Earth from being destroyed by Cell, Vegeta is devastated to the point that he vows never to fight again. Indeed, it would seem that Vegeta's most unique relationship is with his fellow Saiyan. Since their first battle, his opinion of Goku always being one step ahead of him, even though Goku is a lower class Saiyan, runs the gamut from contempt to rivalry, and later to respect and friendship. After the defeat of Kid Buu, he has a change of heart and his angry grudge against Goku becomes a friendly rivalry, though he will always get annoyed and even infuriated when someone openly refers to him as second-best to Goku, such as Whis and Top . Vegeta also maintains a hint of envy and fury whenever Goku reaches a new height, such as Kaiō-Ken X10 or Ultra Instinct (though in the case of the latter, he ultimately accepted that that was one power unique to only Goku himself). He'll even jump at the chance to see Goku beaten by his hand even if the circumstances are technical, such as when he rooted for his copy-version to defeat Goku and opted to fight Goku Black just because he looked like Goku himself. Even so, Vegeta expressed his disdain for Black's shameless theft of his Saiyan brother's vessel, pummeling him as he reveals that Goku worked hard his whole life to achieve his strength and that regardless of his resemblance, he will never compare to the original. Despite his respect and friendship with Goku, he still gets highly annoyed with his immature tendencies and is shocked and even a bit disgusted by the fact that despite having a wife (and two sons), Goku has no concept of romance (never having kissed Chi-Chi apparently) and therefore finds it hard to believe that he is still married. Naturally, Goku almost always takes an optimistic opinion about Vegeta and openly admits to liking him but does occasionally criticize him for his brutality and not informing him when he is about to train. Possibly as a means of reminding him of his heritage despite his upbringing on Earth, Vegeta will nearly always refer to Goku by his birth name Kakarot, scarcely referring to him by his Earth name otherwise. In addition, particularly later on in the series, Vegeta will consistently agree with Goku during moments where he is mature, decisive, and perceptive, such as when he demanded that Trunks obey Goku's order to help resurrect Piccolo, when Goku pointed out the dangers of Future Zamasu still being around despite Whis' efforts, and especially when Goku expressed disdain at the idea of avoiding single combat during the Tournament of Power , which Vegeta translates as meaning their blood won't allow them to act primarily as a unit. As a perhaps ultimate symbol of his friendship and trust in Goku, Vegeta gave him the rest of his energy and an impassioned speech that proved instrumental in allowing him to complete Ultra Instinct during his battle with Jiren, earlier even mocking Belmod for his stance concerning Goku's potential. In the manga, Pan calls him \"Uncle Vegeta\", even though they are not blood-related, signifying a meaningful bond between Vegeta's family and Goku's.\n\nBecause of his arrogance, attitude and past wrongdoing, Vegeta gains much disdain from those around him, particularly Piccolo, Krillin, and Tien , who continually admonished him for his brutality. However, after his plan to defeat Kid Buu and save the Earth is a success, Vegeta is recognized as one of the most reliable and strongest warriors known, and this allows him to not only reconcile with all the Z Fighters but to accept them as genuine comrades. Though they grew up apart, Vegeta does care about his younger brother Tarble , though he is highly disappointed with Tarble's extreme lack of fighting power despite the fact he comes from the powerful royal bloodline.\n\nAfter the Kid Buu Saga, Vegeta is much more relaxed. He is often seen smiling and cracking jokes, such as when he forced Trunks to enter the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament , threatening to \"cut his allowance\" if he did not enter the competition. Often being more caring and kinder to his family, especially his daughter, Bulla, Vegeta admittedly has a kinder side, per his adjustment to Earthling life. His attitude towards fighting also changed; instead of training to surpass Goku, he is simply training because he is curious about what his own limits are. He does still retain his rivalry with Goku but following his revelation at the end of the Buu Saga, Vegeta only wants to beat Goku purely to test himself rather than prove superiority. Vegeta later developed a strong age crisis, such as ignoring a group of teenagers flirting with his daughter until they called him a \"geezer\" and when Dr. Myuu criticized Vegeta for continuing to voice his pride as a Saiyan prince despite how much he had aged. During Dragon Ball Super , however, Vegeta has been shown to retain his arrogance and competitive mood, but he is more open to teamwork with the Z Fighters and is willing to help others in need. He has grown protective of the planet as he refers to it as his home and doesn't want to bear the burden of losing another home planet as he did with Planet Vegeta. He also develops strong morals, as he rejected Whis' offer to become the next Universe 7 God of Destruction and refused to rejoin forces with Frieza.\n\nDue to his initial lack of sentiment, Vegeta regarded familial bonds as inferior. Vegeta showed little to no interest in fatherhood when Trunks was born and viewed him as only Bulma's child because Vegeta never wanted to have children. But Vegeta gradually came to understand the gratitude of having a family and home to return to. He even cited being able to teach Trunks everything he knows as a priority to be a father. He will often decline to participate in family activities in favor of training, which he justifies on the grounds of enhancing his strength to protect the world. Vegeta is aware this affects his family, but he nevertheless strongly hints his appreciation for his family, as the Tournament of Power was being arranged, Vegeta initially turned down participating to witness the birth of his daughter. Vegeta also desires for Trunks to follow in his footsteps as a warrior but not so with Bulla, whom he dotes on, and gradually accepts if his children choose different paths as long as they are happy and safe. He is shown to be protective of his family, as it is shown Vegeta is unable to see his wife and children in pain or danger, which later serves as motivation for him to boost his capabilities in battle. Also, despite being nervous upon learning Bulma's second pregnancy, Vegeta was happy to learn he was having a daughter and enjoyed taking care of Bulla. However, he raised Trunks with a combination of respect and discipline, to where Trunks avoids misbehaving in his father's presence. Even more, he is willing to go to extreme methods to protect his family, including humiliation on his part for the sake of their well-being, and he is offended when he learns Goku would prefer training rather than spend time with his children. He is also proud of Future Trunks giving everything he had to protect his world from Zamasu and even protected Future Trunks from one of Fused Zamasu's attacks. His care for Future Trunks was further established in Super Dragon Ball Heroes where seeing Future Trunks' life was in danger by the hand of Cumber , he chose to willingly put on the Potara earring to fuse with Goku, something he was not willing to do before. In Bojack Unbound , he also willingly went to confront Bojack after seeing his son in danger from his men on TV and even made sure to bring Future Trunks' sword along to supply it to him, when earlier he was unwilling to participate in or ever watch the Intergalactic Tournament due to losing the will to fight as a result of Goku's death. On a similar note, after Piccolo accidentally reveals that the boy who defeated Frieza earlier was actually a future version of his then-newborn son, Vegeta privately expresses pride that his son would grow to become that strong, a stark contrast to the period between Frieza's death and the Androids' ambush, where he felt threatened by the boy's ability to become Super Saiyan.\n\nIn the anime , Vegeta is shown to have a fear of worms, as when the small roundworms appear behind a larger one when inside Buu , Vegeta bolts behind Goku. On a similar note, he apparently wasn't fond of vulgar elements, which was best evidenced after the events of the Majin Buu Saga where he didn't join in laughter over Chi-Chi chasing Gotenks after Goku forced him out of an outdoor bath and coldly stated it was vulgar (this was changed in the English dub to him breaking the fourth wall by asking what the viewer was looking at). He apparently was also not fond of wearing apparently feminine clothing, as evidenced by his shocked and horrified reaction when he realized Bulma provided him with a pink shirt after he showered upon his return to Earth.\n\nIn addition to his wife and children, it is implied that on some level Vegeta cared and looked up to his father , despite his claims to the contrary. His father was one of the greatest influences on young Vegeta, instilling in him his strong Saiyan pride as well as his early elitist views. Vegeta also tried to defend his father from Beerus showing that he indeed cared for him which is also supported by his assertion that he followed Frieza when he was younger cause Frieza had threatened his father. While Vegeta coldly seemed to care little for his father when Frieza mentioned killing him, it is likely he kept his true feelings towards his father to himself as such emotions were considered a sign of weakness among the Saiyans. In addition to his father, Vegeta has a positive relationship with his younger brother which is ironically in contrast to Goku and Raditz's relationship. Though Vegeta is ashamed of his brother's weakness like his father as he gets along well with him despite this though this may be due to Tarble looking up to Vegeta and even letting his brother believe he was responsible for defeating Frieza. It is unknown how they got along when they were younger as Vegeta had mellowed when it came to his family by the time, they in Dragon Ball: The Return of Son Goku and Friends! though he apparently chose not to reveal he had a brother even to his own wife and children until Tarble appeared on Earth. It is also implied that his comrades (with the potential exception of Nappa who may have kept quiet about it out of respect for the royal family and not to upset Vegeta) were unaware of Tarble as Raditz never mentioned Tarble or any other Saiyan survivors indicating that he was unaware that Vegeta had a younger brother. However, it is possible that Vegeta may have secretly wished to protect the gentle Tarble from Frieza in addition to protecting the reputation of the Saiyan royal family.\n\nVegeta tends to be hotheaded and quick-tempered during battles, especially ones not in his favor. According to Whis, the Saiyan Prince is too tense during fights and thinks too much before acting, putting a limit on his speed. Whis recommended that Vegeta needs to relax once in a while and not be so focused on training constantly since it is too intense for him to concentrate.\n\nDuring the beginning of the Tournament of Destroyers , Vegeta shows a great interest in the Saiyans from Universe 6 , asking Cabba what the name of their homeworld is, and asking Cabba if he could learn more about the Saiyans of Universe 6, which is very uncanny of Vegeta as he rarely questions about the affairs of other people or planets. This shows that he has a deep-seeded passion and even curiosity about his race. Vegeta takes an instant interest in Cabba similar to a teacher-student relationship, going as far as to teach Cabba how to transform into Super Saiyan, expressing sadness when Cabba and Universe 6 are erased by the Zenos, and vowing to resurrect Cabba and his universe with the Super Dragon Balls .\n\nVegeta has often been shown to have a deep dislike for fighters who use unfair methods for a fight, which shows that he is someone who prefers to fight with dignity. An example of this was during the Tournament of Power, when Universe 2 warrior Prum acted as a sniper and tried to eliminate Vegeta (only managing to cut his cheek), the Saiyan Prince furiously insulted him, calling him a dishonorable coward and a shameless worm. He also shows contempt for those who abandon their own values and code as Top, who in Vegeta's eyes was only a loser who cannot even protect his own pride. He also views Moro with disgust, stating how he takes the power of others and does not give a fair fight and the reason he does this is because his true power is extremely weak.\n\nDuring the Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga , Vegeta reflected on his last visit to Planet Namek , expressed guilt over what he had done to the Namekians , and vowed to protect them and New Namek from Moro as a form of atonement. Piccolo also notes on this sense of atonement from Vegeta, amazed by how much Vegeta has grown as a person and how he is now fighting for the planet in an attempt to make up for his past and wipe the slate clean by defeating Moro. Vegeta has also come to accept the sins of his past, stating that when he dies, he will surely go to Hell because he is a villain and has come to accept the consequences for his actions, but still fights for the planet in his attempt to make up for those actions, demonstrating his significant change of character. This change of character is also shown after Moro's invasion: while conversing with Beerus on his world, Vegeta shows deep shame in the Saiyans' past of bloodshed and domination, fully accepting their crimes while also admitting Frieza wasn't responsible for their crimes. During the Granolah the Survivor Saga , after acquiring Ultra Ego and his training with Beerus, Vegeta noted that unlike the past, he could not throw away his morality to utilize the form to its full potential. This shows that Vegeta's morality, despite being more ruthless than Goku's, has developed to the point where he cannot return fully to the brutal and cold warrior he once was.",
      "Personality--Relationship with Bulma": "{\" Servant woman, bring me a drying cloth at once! \" — Vegeta ordering Bulma to bring him a towel after a shower in \" Frieza's Counterattack \"}\n\nBulma suggests that Vegeta takes a bath\n\nVegeta and Bulma initially met on planet Namek, but neither actually talked to the other; Bulma was scared of Vegeta, and he did not care, especially when his main concern was to find the Dragon Balls . However, their first interaction with each other was prior to his rematch with Zarbon , to which Vegeta threatened to kill both Bulma and Krillin. The first time any affection is displayed between them is in \" Immortality Denied \", in which Vegeta, during a conversation with Gohan, refers to Bulma as a \"Gorgeous Girl\" in the Ocean Group dubs . The first hint of Bulma's attraction to Vegeta is right after Goku's battle with Frieza and Planet Namek's destruction, in which Bulma told Vegeta she thought he was cute and that he should lighten up a bit, much to his bafflement.\n\nDespite their rocky start, Bulma was more than willing to put up with Vegeta, even if he scared her. Upon his resurrection after being killed by Frieza, and then being teleported to Earth, Bulma invites Vegeta to live at Capsule Corporation as he has nowhere to go on the condition that he does not touch her. Vegeta reluctantly accepts her offer but quickly leaves Earth in search of Goku after he discovers his unwillingness to return to Earth from Porunga . During his absence on Earth, Bulma begins to slowly but surely show signs of affection towards the Saiyan Prince, after having a dream about him; she also shows a deep concern for him after being informed that his ship is about to run out of fuel soon. Her then-boyfriend Yamcha not only begins to get jealous but also shows resentment towards Vegeta, who has no idea about Bulma's feelings towards him. When Vegeta returns to Earth, he becomes irritated at her for her domineering attitude and criticism towards his rude behavior, but he often ends up submitting to her demands, much to everyone's amazement of how much Bulma can keep Vegeta under control.\n\nBulma showing affection towards Vegeta after he was injured during his training\n\nAt one time, Vegeta is seriously injured after his training capsule explodes while he tries to train under 300 times Earth's gravity . Bulma shows immense concern for Vegeta and tries to convince him to stop training and to rest. Vegeta defiantly attempts to return to his training but collapses, and Bulma then takes him to Capsule Corp to nurse him back to health. Later, Vegeta awakes to find Bulma asleep beside him and wonders why she's there (having no idea of Bulma's feelings for him). When Bulma sees Vegeta return to training, she firmly tells him to stop because of his injuries, but Vegeta refuses to listen and shouts at her to leave him alone. This leaves Bulma feeling very bitter about Vegeta and his stubbornness for a while afterward.\n\nAfter approximately a year after Future Trunks ' warning about the Androids , Bulma breaks up with Yamcha and has an affair with Vegeta, ultimately leading to the conception of Trunks , though this event is never expanded upon. However, even the birth of their son was not enough to bring the two together, since at that time, Vegeta prioritized his rivalry with Goku before anything else, even his relationship with Bulma. In the Japanese version, Future Trunks states that his birth was the result of a one-night stand, whereas in the Funimation dub, it was said to have been simply a short-lived affair. Arguments were common between the two, with Bulma often calling Vegeta a \"jerk\" and Vegeta showing little to no care or emotion for either his son or his future wife; this was demonstrated during an incident in which Bulma's plane is destroyed, and their lives are at risk. When Future Trunks saves the two and questions Vegeta as to why he did not try to save them, Vegeta responds that he has \"more important things to worry about than that foolish woman and her blasted child .\" Bulma later humiliates Vegeta in front of everyone when she says that every time, he sticks his \"Ugly Mug\" up to Trunks, it makes Trunks cry, much to Krillin and Gohan's amusement and Vegeta's anger.\n\nVegeta with his family\n\nVegeta's and Bulma exhibited indifference towards each other throughout the Androids and Cell Games Saga, which puzzled everyone, considering the two had a child together. Future Trunks states to Goku that in his timeline, even though Bulma fell in love with Vegeta, they did not stay together very long because their attraction was solely based on passion and loneliness, and with Vegeta's goals and priorities not concerning Bulma, they had no reason to continue the relationship. Also, in the alternate timeline, Future Vegeta was killed by the Androids soon after Trunks was born, so his relationship with Bulma did not have a chance to progress in that timeline.\n\nHowever, the seven years of peace that came after the conclusion of the Cell Games would suggest that the two settled their differences and began to have a much better relationship than previously, as they were already married by the time the Majin Buu conflict took place. Initially choosing to remain on Earth and marry Bulma because he wanted to be there for Trunks, Vegeta eventually became fond of his family and it became apparent that he had fallen deeply in love with Bulma by the time of the Majin Buu Saga but was ashamed of himself for doing so and for sacrificing his warrior lifestyle for the sake of his family, wanting to be the cold-hearted prince he once was. He attempted to return to his former self by allowing Babidi take control of him and denouncing his ties to Bulma and Trunks, but Goku deduced that Vegeta was bluffing when Vegeta admitted he felt torn between his desire to be evil again to get stronger versus his growing love for his family and the contentment of living on Earth. Nonetheless, Vegeta eventually realizes what is really important in his life, and he feels remorse for betraying his family just to fulfill an empty goal he knows he can't achieve. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save his family and Earth when fighting Majin Buu, although it was in vain. When he learns his family has been killed or absorbed by Majin Buu, Vegeta is overcome with sadness and rage that he lost his wife and son, and is even willing to fuse with Goku, even if permanently, because he wants to avenge his family. After Majin Buu's defeat, Vegeta's accomplishment in saving the Earth was enough for Bulma to forgive him, and from then onward, their relationship became more content and happier, as Vegeta acknowledged he truly wishes to remain on Earth with his family.\n\nBy the start of the Kid Buu Saga , Vegeta begins to show a comical side regarding his love for Bulma. He throws at fit at Goku when he finds out that Goku promised Old Kai sexy pictures of Bulma, and in Dragon Ball Daima , becomes irritated with Hybis for asking Bulma to be his girlfriend despite knowing Vegeta and Bulma are already married. He does have a naughtier side to their relationship, becoming embarrassed when Hybis accuses him of liking big breasts, and even moreso when Bulma publicly shouts at him to stop fighting Gomah or else she won't bathe with him anymore. He also sometimes shows jealousy towards other men who are around Bulma, such as ordering Jaco to not try anything \"suspicious\" with her. Vegeta was also seen completely shocked and embarrassed when Goku is at his house with Bulma when she is wearing only a towel, and his face turns red when Goku notes that Bulma's breasts are sagging.\n\n{\" How... dare you?! THAT'S MY BULMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!! \" — Vegeta to Beerus after the latter slapped Bulma in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods}\n\nVegeta's rage after Bulma was hit by Beerus\n\nBy his own admission, Vegeta's respect for and attraction to Bulma is known to be partially due to her somewhat overbearing and willful personality, as it has been noted in the past that such qualities were much sought after in mates by Saiyan males (including Goku). Her ability to intimidate her overwhelmingly- strong husband is both a source of irritation as well as attraction to Vegeta, as his often quietly menacing body language and expressions are known to terrify most humans with no effort.\n\nVegeta taking back his rude comment towards Bulma\n\nIn Dragon Ball Super , Vegeta's relationship with Bulma has grown to be a very loving one. When Beerus slapped her despite Vegeta's pleas to not hurt her, Vegeta flew into a heated rage and attacked Beerus, whom he was initially afraid of; Master Roshi and Goku note that Vegeta's power surpassed the latter's in that moment of anger. He has also grown to fear Bulma's temper and tries to avoid angering her, such as when he mentioned Trunks and Goten wouldn't have left with Monaka if Bulma hadn't ordered the supplies and she accused him of blaming her, and he took back what he said. He has grown to be protective of her and proud of her, often praising her inventions and will do anything she says even if he doesn't want to. When Future Trunks arrived in the past and informed him of the events in his timeline, Vegeta secretly felt sad that Future Bulma was killed and vowed to never forgive Goku Black when he was alone. This showed that regardless of the difference in the timelines that Vegeta cares deeply about his wife, and that no matter the incarnation, Bulma is Bulma to him. He did, however, express silent, extreme annoyance when Bulma told Goten and Trunks that Goku is the best chance they have against Goku Black and Zamasu, not once mentioning him despite the fact that the future they are fighting for is their (which means, also his ) son's and starts to yell at her before Gohan and Chi-Chi arrive. When Bulma was pregnant with their daughter Bulla, Vegeta not only chose against training for Zeno's tournament so that he could be by his wife's side during the birth, but he dropped training altogether to take care of her throughout the pregnancy. Vegeta was displeased when Bulma named their daughter without his consultation, as he wanted to give their daughter a Saiyan name out of respect for his heritage, but he quickly accepted the name. Although Vegeta refused to cooperate with Frieza in the Tournament of Power, Vegeta was willing to set aside this resentment because he wanted to save his wife and children from erasure if their universe loses. As he was losing against Jiren , Vegeta thought of Bulma and their children, giving him the desire to protect them. When Vegeta ultimately lost, he felt guilty for failing to protect his family and shed tears as he apologized to Bulma.",

      "Profile": "The Shogun is the second puppet to be made after Ei wanted to create a body which could resist erosion. Her first attempt was Scaramouche , which she deemed a failure because he shed tears upon creation, which made her to believe that he was too fragile for the task. Like him, the Shogun has a consciousness of her own. She is connected to the storms of Inazuma , and wields the sword (Musou Isshin) that houses Ei in battle. The Shogun was created with a set list of rules that cannot be altered or shut off. According to Ei, she does not see the Shogun as an entity separate from herself, claiming that the Shogun counts as a different form of her existence and that she never intended to leave Inazuma in the hands of anybody but herself.\n\nPrior to the Traveler's arrival to Inazuma, the Shogun was manipulated by the Fatui into issuing the Vision Hunt Decree , who had been assisted by the Kujou and Hiiragi Clan after they had been promised power by them. When Kazuha's Friend attempted to challenge her over it with a duel before the throne, the Shogun had Kujou Sara duel him, who won, and per the rules, she executed him with the Musou no Hitotachi .\n\nDuring the Inazuma Archon Quest series, the Shogun is first seen attempting to confiscate Thoma 's Vision after having him captured despite his ties to the Kamisato Clan , one of the three clans forming the Tri-Commission . The Traveler , attempting to intervene, instead gets dragged into the Plane of Euthymia , where Ei defeats and ejects them. The Shogun then tries to execute the Traveler, but the distraction was long enough that Thoma was able to break free from his bindings and threw a spear at her, forcing her to abort as they escaped. She then issued for the Traveler's capture.\n\nAfter learning the extent of the Fatui manipulation in Inazuma, Kujou Sara attempted to inform the Shogun, but was instead knocked out by La Signora when she arrived. The Shogun chastised her for punishing one of her subjects, decreeing that only she could do so. The Traveler then informed her of the Fatui's plot, though when she did not appear to be convinced, instead issued a duel before the throne. Signora, overconfident in her powers, was defeated by the Traveler and per the rules of the duel, the Shogun moved in to execute her with the Musou no Hitotachi. The Shogun then allowed them to leave the castle grounds alive; upon stepping outside the castle, she emerged to attack them, but Kazuha, who had arrived with the rest of the resistance, managed to parry the attack with his and his friend's Vision. Before the Shogun could attempt to attack the resistance, the Traveler attacked her first, causing them to be brought back to the Plane of Euthymia, where they defeated Ei, who agreed to change her views and attempted to do so to the Shogun.\n\nThe Shogun, having been designed to resist change, instead believed that Ei was succumbing to erosion and tried to stop her by refusing to comply with her orders as riftwolves were emerging in Inazuma. Ei, realizing the Shogun was responsible for stopping the body from moving, challenges her inside Makoto's consciousness to prove that she has not been corrupted. As a result of temporal disruption and the Shogun's will, the two dueled for five centuries straight. Ei's new perspectives allowed her to defeat the Shogun, who conceded. She then asked it to serve as her kagemusha, which it accepted.\n\nWhen Yae wanted to start the Mikawa Flower Festival , she met with the Shogun, discussing who would be the perfect representative for the festival. Yae invited the Traveler over, and the two agreed that they should be the festival's representative, given that they were not Inazuman and had connections to the youkai.",

      "Plot": "When Light loses his memories by relinquishing his notebook, he plans to regain ownership by killing its new owner. In order to do this, he cuts a piece of paper from the Death Note and places it in a compartment that opens from the bottom of his watch. The compartment only reveals itself when he pulls the crown of his watch four times with less than a second in-between pulls. A needle is also placed in the compartment in case Light needs to draw blood to use as a writing instrument (such as situations where he does not have a pen on him).\n\nThe watch is instrumental in his plan to wipe his memories and regain the Death Note. Because the watch is a gift from his father, Light keeps the watch on him at all times and knows he will do so even after his memories are erased. When Higuchi , the acting Kira at the time, is caught, Light discreetly kills Higuchi while holding onto the notebook in order to keep his memories and regain ownership.\n\nThe watch is also used by Light to kill Takada and make her set fire to her surroundings in order to get rid of any evidence that she killed Mello with a page from the Death Note. However, Light's subordinate, Mikami , is unaware of Light having the access to a snippet of the notebook, and takes out the real Death Note (which was in hiding) in attempt to also kill Takada; this notebook is subsequently exposed to Near and his team and used as evidence to implicate Light and Mikami.\n\nDuring the final stand against Near , Light attempts to use a piece of the Death Note to kill the former as a last resort, but his plan is thwarted by Matsuda after he shoots him. The snippet is then confiscated by Aizawa .",
      "In other media--L: Change the WorLd novel": "In the novel L: Change the World , L wears Light's broken watch throughout the story as a memento.\n\nIn one scene, L and Maki Nikaido talk about Kira and how L failed to catch him since Kira died. L wraps his hand \"protectively\" around the watch. Maki asks him what he's thinking about, and L says, \"I was thinking about my only friend.\" She asks if the broken watch belonged to the friend, and L says yes.",
      "Trivia": "[ -In the films, Light only needs to pry the compartment of the watch open and does not need to pull the crown at all.\n-Although dying in different times relative to their continuity, it is interesting to note that in the manga, anime, and the films, Light kills Takada using a piece of the Death Note hidden in the watch.\n-Yuki Shien\n uses a similar watch in the film Death Note: Light Up the NEW World\n, presumably in homage to Light.\n-The watch appears to be a Limited, Japan-only edition OMEGA (r) Speed-Master Professional (Reference: 35704000); however, in the anime, it resembles it slightly less. The same OMEGA watch is famous for being the first watch to be worn on the moon, which has some relevance to Light's name in Kanji.\n-Prior to being gifted this watch, Light wore a Swatch Irony Big Chairoplane YGS4016AG.\n-In the live-actipn film series, Light wore a Citizen Alterna VO10-5995f.\n-A replica of Light's watch was created as official merchandise in 2020, complete with a retractable compartment. ]",

      "Plot": "Rokuro Okajima is meek, mundane, and metropolitan. His business trip to South East Asia turns from pleasure cruise to festival of pain when modern pirates board the ship and take him hostage. Revy, Dutch and Benny are merciless, maniacal, and mean. Together, they make up the crew of the Black Lagoon. Making a living in a city where the most villainous of villains make themselves at home isn't without its risks, but they take on any job available to them. Smuggling guns, drugs, kidnapped children, and stolen goods is all part of a hard days work.\n\nTheir base of operations is located in the fictional harbor city of Roanapur in southeast Thailand (somewhere in the Amphoe Mueang Trat district, likely on the mainland north/northeast of the Ko Chang island or on the island itself). They transport goods in the 80-foot (24 m) Elco-type PT boat Black Lagoon . Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions—which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles—in various Southeast Asian locations, even going as far as Phu Quoc island of Vietnam and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur which is often destroyed in firefights.\n\nBlack Lagoon includes a considerable amount of graphic violence, often involving violent gun fights and spectacular physical feats in battle. Many of the characters who are most skilled with weapons (mainly guns) are women, thereby bearing a similarity with \"girls-with-guns\" genre with the six strongest women in the series adhering to some type of stereotype (dragon lady, referring to Revy, maids, referring to Roberta and Fabiola, nuns, referring to Eda, etc.). Some of the scenes and dialogue are within the realm of dark comedy, as humorous moments occur or are mentioned during and after many violent battles.",
      "Characters": "Rock (Rokuro \"Rock\" Okajima) — is the main protagonist of the series. He is a Japanese salaryman who joins the crew of the Black Lagoon after they kidnap him. Rock does not fight but is an excellent negotiator and translator, and apparently does the accounting for the Black Lagoon Company. He is often scared by the methods Revy sometimes uses to achieve her goals. He appears to be quite intelligent and can talk himself out of trouble as seen when he manages to talk a very angry Balalaika out of shooting him for arguing with her. Dutch states that he sees a darkness in Rock as well as in Benny. As the show progresses Rock's personality seems to change as he does not like to take violent measures or harm others but starts to care less when others suffer starting with Gretels death at the hands of Balalaika.\n\nRevy — is the female protagonist of the series, she provides the muscle for the Lagoon Company. She is of Chinese descent and grew up in New York City. Revy is exceptionally skilled with using firearms in battle, but is not much of a people person. She enjoys killing her enemies and seldom stops to negotiate. Despite her usual indifferent demeanor, her tendency to enjoy taking the lives of others is a result of her internal emotional instability, as evidenced by her more conflicting interactions with Rock. While her personality constantly clashes with Rock's, she seems to spend quite a bit of time with him and admits that she does consider him her friend. It is possible she has romantic feelings for him since she can never seem to give Eda a straight answer when she asks about her and Rocks sexual relations. Her signature weapon is a brace of custom-made stainless steel 9 mm Beretta 92 \"Sword Cutlass Special\" pistols. Her nickname \"Two Hand\" reflects her ability to use both pistols simultaneously. Because Japanese-to-Western transliteration conflates R with L, and B with V, her name is sometimes rendered as Levy, and sometimes attributed as a nickname for Rebecca (which she has identified herself with in the English dub).\n\nDutch — is the leader of the Lagoon \"trading company.\" An African-American, he captains the PT boat Black Lagoon, and coordinates his crew. Although he seldom participates in battle, he is still a deadly adversary, stemming from his time as a Marine in the Vietnam War. He is much smarter than he appears and can easily read people intentions and feelings. He seems to have some past relation with Balalaika where either one or both of them owe the other some form of debt. He is always calm and level headed and keeps Rock and Revy's emotions in check and keeps them thinking clearly.\n\nBenny — is a former post-graduate student at the University of Central Florida. He is of Jewish descent and serves as the Lagoon's technical expert. He joined the crew when he \"managed to piss off the FBI and the mafia at the same time\" prompting Revy to step in and save him, offering him a job with Lagoon. Like Rock, he is not a gunfighter and does not have the capacity to kill in cold blood. However, he is hardened to the job and willing to overlook almost anything to get the job done.\n\nRock\nRevy\nDutch\nBenny",

      "Approval": "9/5/18 3 feats (1 banked) bori v3.6",
      "Appearance and Personality": "Appearance\nAkira is a dark-skinned kunoichi of Kumogakure. Her hair has been sloppily chopped off at her shoulders and tries to stick up in various directions. Two braids wrap around her head, meeting at the back where they are pinned in place. Her eyes are perhaps her most noticeable feature, as they shine gold like molten lava.She wears a mesh short-sleeved shirt under a sleeveless, gray turtleneck dress. The dress reaches mid-thigh but has slits on either side up to her hip to allow for a better range of motion. A thin black belt cinches the dress at her waist, also holding a series of pouches on both her right and left sides. Under the dress, she wears a pair of dark, cropped pants. She has knotted her shinobi headband around her upper right thigh, where it peeks out through the slit of her dress.She's often seen covered in bruises and cuts, and the bags under her eyes are extremely prominent. Due to a... training incident, her eyebrows were burned off. They're slowly growing back.\n\nPersonality\nAkira used to be a\nvibrant child, always brimming with imaginative tales waiting to be told.\nSometimes, a glimpse at that child like energy can be seen in the slight smiles\nor the spark in her eyes. Sometimes, if she's particularly interested, she can\nshow some of that passion she keeps buried deep inside.Most of the time,\nhowever, it's hard to remember that she's but a child. She works with a\nfeverish passion, often pushing herself until her muscles scream for rest, and\nthen a little beyond that. If she's not exercising her body, she exercises her\nmind or her creativity. Her apartment is a mess of scrolls, books, and various\nscattered papers with illegible notes or scribbled out drawings. Sleep only\ncomes in the form of an exhausted faint, where even at her weakest, she still\ntwists and turns away from the nightmares that haunt her.Unfortunately for\nthe people around her, Akira holds her companions to similar standards of\npainstaking perseverance. People who don't keep up with her hellish schedule\nor, Kami forbid, try to stop her from\nkeeping her hellish schedule, are often met with standoffish dismissal. Her\nwalls are too high, too strong, to allow people like that to get even within\nviewing distance. The average person is often met with a similar standoffish\nattitude and really shouldn't expect anything better than the occasional\nsarcastic remark or dry wit. It is only because of a recognition of others\nstrength that she even remembers to show respect for authority.Still. Not everybody\ncan be strong all the time. Akira is, at her core, still that small child with\ntoo many emotions. Too much hope and love for the world.She can keep her\nbrave face only so long before she must crawl away from sight and break down\nfrom stress. Stress of her past, of her future, whatever it is. And for every\ntime she breaks, eventually, she manages to slowly pick herself up again. Each\ncrack, each tear, is just another reminder that she's still weak. Still capable of loss.\n\nStats\n\n{Strength | 6}\n{Speed | 7}\n{Chakra Levels | 9}\n{Chakra Control | 10}\n{Endurance | 7}\n{CP | 65}\n{Banked | 0}\nRank Upgrades\n\n{Genin 1 | Ink Techniques}\n{Genin 2 | Sealing Specialist}\n{Chunin | N/A}\n{Jonin | N/A}\n{S-Rank | N/A}\n{Kage Rank | N/A}\nAbilities\n\nFeats earned so far: 3 Banked feats: 1\nInk Techniques\n[ -Ink Creation\n - The user draws a creature on their paper.

She soon had two little brothers to look after, too, and she loved them as her mother and father had loved her. Even with the tension that lingered in the air, Akira grew up with a relatively normal childhood. Her father, still an active shinobi even after his wife had retired to care for the kids, would spend whatever free time he had playing with and teaching his children fun little ninja tricks. From him, she learned how to aim and throw weapons. From her mother, however, she learned the joy of art. She learned how to transform every stroke into a story, and, in a happy little accident (her father refuses to admit he'd been nudging her towards it), learned how to transform a series of stroke into an actual chakra construct.Then Masura became the kage, and things took a turn for the worse. Her father never came home from a patrol mission. They said he had defected, had abandoned his family at the promise of a better life elsewhere. Like the fool she was, she had believed them. She'd resented him, refused to speak about him with her mother or her brothers. He was a disgrace. He had left them. Left her .

      "History and Story": "Pre-Graduation\nAkira was born and raised in Kumogakure to a loving family. She soon had two little brothers to look after, too, and she loved them as her mother and father had loved her. Even with the tension that lingered in the air, Akira grew up with a relatively normal childhood. Her father, still an active shinobi even after his wife had retired to care for the kids, would spend whatever free time he had playing with and teaching his children fun little ninja tricks. From him, she learned how to aim and throw weapons. From her mother, however, she learned the joy of art. She learned how to transform every stroke into a story, and, in a happy little accident (her father refuses to admit he'd been nudging her towards it), learned how to transform a series of stroke into an actual chakra construct.Then Masura became the kage, and things took a turn for the worse. Her father never came home from a patrol mission. They said he had defected, had abandoned his family at the promise of a better life elsewhere. Like the fool she was, she had believed them. She'd resented him, refused to speak about him with her mother or her brothers. He was a disgrace. He had left them. Left her . Like the kunoichi he had groomed her to be, she was so disappointed that he would even dare to defect.The Oni Lord's arrival brought devastation to Akira Tanaka's life. During the evacuation out of the endangered Kumogakure, her mother was crushed into the ground while trying to protect the civilians.

There are eventually four platforms discovered, a pair of which obtain collectible Vegetables\n on them. There is eventually another floating and moving cloud, then four more platforms are discovered before reaching the peak, where the Ice Climbers\n can grab onto the flying Condor\n who flies from side-to-side by jumping towards it and grabbing onto its feet. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 2": "[ -After the standard bonus beginning, the bonus level features three platforms that can be reached through jumping, although there are flying clouds between them. The subsequent platform requires the assistance of a cloud. The following section is centered at the top of the mountain and requires a flying cloud to access, leading to the player accessing the peak of the mountain, and then Ice Climbers\n must grab onto the flying Condor\n who flies from side-to-side by jumping towards it and grabbing onto its feet to accomplish this mountain. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 3": "[ -Upon approaching the bonus stage of the third mountain, the first section features three-separate solid floors/terrain, and the four subsequent sections are slow-moving and flying clouds, meaning that falling off the highest cloud possible causes the player to fall off the screen and fail to accomplish the mountain. The following two sections are solid terrain before the subsequent section features another flying cloud, then after that is the peak of the mountain, where the Condor\n must be grabbed on to accomplish the mountain. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 4": "[ -The fourth mountain's bonus stage features rather a simplistic bunch of platforms. While a flying cloud is given, none are necessary, until approaching the top that requires riding a pair of flying clouds to reach a center platform. From there, the Condor\n can be reached at the peak of the fourth mountain. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 5": "[ -This is platform-jumping with a small amount of flying clouds at the top. If the player retains acknowledge of the previous mountain\n's low difficulty on the bonus stage, this should be simple to accomplish for the player as well. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 6": "[ -After the standard bonus bottom, there is a flying-cloud surface. The player must jump on the flying cloud to access the platform to the right, collect the vegetables\n, then re-access the cloud to access the corresponding vegetables on the left. The player eventually must get on the subsequent flying cloud, get on the next three-there, two-not surface. Afterwards, the player must access the pair of subsequent flying clouds to get on the platform on the center, then access the peak of the mountain, where the Condor\n must be grabbed to accomplish the mountain. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 7": "[ -Despite the medium difficulty of the seventh mountain, the bonus stage has a lot of platforms. Each one can be reached from one below it. This should be heavily simplistic to complete. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 8": "[ -The eighth mountain's bonus stage is slightly more challenging in comparison to the previous mountains\n due to featuring slightly thinner platforms and flying clouds, alongside the latter possessing above-average speed. Regardless, its difficulty is overall medium-to-easy. The first four sections are solid, albeit slightly scattered, and the three subsequent sections are small and medium-speed flying clouds. The two subsequent and the final sections represent solid surfaces and a flying cloud, respectively, before approaching the peak of the mountain, where the Condor\n must be grabbed. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 9": "[ -Most of the ninth mountain's bonus stage fittingly consists of solid terrain with only the representation of two sections with wide and slow-moving clouds in between them. ]",
      "List of bonus stages--Mountain 10": "[ -The first platform with the second-highest vegetable\n is reachable without using a flying cloud. The one with the highest vegetable is not. The subsequent platform is reachable from either of the two lower platforms. The subsequent platform requires a cloud to get to; unfortunately, that particular cloud is slow. Another cloud is required after that platform to reach the highest platform, after which, reaching the top is easy. ]",

      "Appearance": "Main article: Stocking/Gallery\n\n[ -Stocking in \"Excretion Without Honor and Humanity\n\".\n-Stocking in \"Bitch Girls 4 Life\n\". ]\n1/2\n\nStocking is of moderate height and buxom figure compared to Panty's slightly slimmer figure. She has pale skin and long dark-blue hair with a pink underside and reaching knee length styled in a hime-cut and some pink stripes on the bangs, and has a blue bow adorned at the back of her hair. She has teal eyes with prominent, triangular lower eyelashes, and she always carries an apathetic, deadpan expression on her face.",
      "Appearance--Outfit--Human form": "Stocking dresses in a dark-colored, gothic Lolita style. In her human form, she wears a black short dress with puffy sleeves and a white laced underside underneath the dress, she wears a white collared blouse with a blue western bow-tie, along with a large blue bow which is tied backwards around her waist. She wears blue-black stripped stockings and a pair of black loafers.\n\nIn season two , Stocking's appearance is slightly altered. Her hair has a gradient which fades from pink to purple. The color of the bottom stripes of Stocking's hair were also changed from pink to purple and her blue to a bluish indigo.",
      "Appearance--Outfit--Angel form (former)": "In her angel form, she wears a white dress with baby blue horizontal stripes, featuring a layered, ruffled skirt trimmed with lace that gives it a soft, floaty look. The bodice has a corset-like design made of silver metallic fabric, detailed with light blue frill trim, and a white bow is tied at the back.\n\nA blue heart sits at the centre of her chest, surrounded by two silver straps that cross over her shoulders. A silver strap is wrapped around her upper chest, and her waist is adorned with two more blue hearts, each accented with ribbon bows.\n\nBeneath the dress, she wears blue-and-white striped stockings, cut at the bottom like leg warmers. Her footwear consists of silver open-toed high heels with silver cross-shaped straps across the top of the foot. At the back of her head, she wears her usual blue bow, along with a silver choker decorated with light blue frills.\n\nOn each wrist, she wears two silver bracelets, and long white sleeves extend from silver rings on her middle fingers to silver armbands resting on her upper arms. Like Panty, she has small, white cherub wings on her back.",
      "Appearance--Outfit--Angel form (current)": "In her new angel form, she wears a frilly, cropped white blouse with puffed sleeves and a heart-shaped chest cutout, accented with bright blue heart motifs and delicate frills. A short, layered frilly skirt with two blue heart bows and long trailing ribbons at the waist is secured by a silver belt-like strap. She wears blue-and-white striped thigh-high stockings styled like a garter belt, each adorned with a heart, and silver open-toed high heels with cross-shaped straps and small wings at the ankles.\n\nAccessories include a silver Civic Crown headband with a blue heart gem and her usual bow, a silver frilled choker, and gloves with frills extending from the middle rings, connected behind her back to a blue heart gem with cascading ribbons. Large white angel wings complete the playful, striking look, unified by the recurring blue heart motifs.",
      "Personality": "Stocking happily eating roll cake in \" The Diet Syndrome \".\n\nStocking's defining trait is her love for sweet food. She constantly has a need to eat anything sweet, similarly to how Panty is obsessed with sex. Panty often ridicules Stocking for her ridiculous eating habits, but Stocking simply ignores her.\n\nHer obsession for sweet food is especially shown in \" The Diet Syndrome \", when she goes insane after trying to go on a diet and quit eating sweets.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Stocking went back to normal after the ghost was defeated and continued eating sweets as if nothing ever happened. Although, it seems that Stocking has calmed her urges, as she stated she was on a diet in \" Independence Dick \". Stocking hates spicy food just as much as Panty hates sweet food.\n\nStocking represents Gluttony , one of the seven deadly sins , due to her love for eating sweet foods. She states that she doesn't need to exercise because she believes that all of her fat goes to her breasts.\n\nStocking would much rather stay at home eating sweets, but unlike Panty and her sex obsession, Stocking doesn't let her love for sweets get in the way of her Ghost-hunting duties, which is why she is let back into Heaven.\n\nStocking is normally a reserved person, but she can make very snarky comments, especially towards Panty. Stocking also possesses a cynical, cold and sardonic demeanor, and because of this, she isn't as popular as Panty, although many people (including women) find Stocking to be attractive.\n\nBetween the Anarchy Sisters, Stocking is the more intelligent of the two (something that even Panty admits in \" Nothing to Room \"), although she is still not completely smart.\n\nIn \" High School Nudical \", she and Panty didn't realize that Master G was Garterbelt , and in \" The Stripping \", she and Panty also didn't realize that the dealer was Kneesocks . While skeptical at first, she, too, fell victim to the trend of nose-picking in \" Raiders of the Nasal Dark \".\n\nStocking sobbing in \" The Ohagi of Doom \".\n\nDespite her normally reserved personality, Stocking is the most emotional of the four girls because she tends to cry when she is overwhelmingly upset. Examples of this are when she becomes too impatient for Garterbelt's upcoming dinner and lashes out at Chuck in \" Nothing to Room \", when she talks to Scanty about how Panty has mistreated her because of her younger age in \" Project S: The Worst Ever Dojo \", when the owner of Diamond Head died in \" The Silence of the Internets \", and when Gunsmith Bitch ate her Ohagi Unicorn for which she had been craving in \" The Ohagi of Doom \". This tendency may imply that Stocking is the youngest of the four girls.\n\nWhile Stocking disapproves of Panty's obsession with sex, she is also shown to have sexual desires, especially that of masochism and BDSM . In \" Catfight Club \" and \" If the Angels Wore Swimsuits \", Stocking is shown getting pleasure out of being entangled, and in \" 1 Angry Ghost \", Stocking ejaculates after being electrocuted repeatedly. In \" Trans-homers \", it is also revealed that Stocking owns a dildo. Stocking also gains immense sexual pleasure, which she says feels better than sex, every time someone likes her Influenstagram posts in \" Bitch Perfect \".\n\nStocking says that she has special standards in men and would rather seek for a long-term relationship rather than a one-night stand. Stocking has a very unusual and strange vision of what being attractive is, as seen in \" Ghost: The Phantom of Daten City \", when she decided against having sex with handsome men and instead fell in love with a gross and utterly shameless ghost.\n\nThere are also rare instances where Stocking is implied to be unchaste, such as in \" Nothing to Room \", when Panty talks about a man who made out with Stocking the night prior. Stocking says she nearly let him have sex with her, but didn't because she wanted to avoid seeming slutty. She also says that she had sex with one of Panty's muscular friends in \" Catfight Club \", though she may have just been trying to provoke Panty.\n\nIn the Manga Strip series, Stocking is just as lewd as Panty, having sex with several men and women.\n\nStocking lovingly hugging Vibe in \" Pet Cematary Hills \".\n\nStocking is prone to finding small creatures very cute. In \" Pulp Addiction \", she instantly adored the Cowpers and even asked Panty if she could adopt one, despite them being evil ghosts.\n\nShe also became enamored with Vibe in \" Pet Cematary Hills \" and yelled at Panty for trying to kill her. In \" Mutant Garterbelts \", Stocking found the baby turtle ghosts to be cute and directed the ghosts towards the sea with the help of Panty.\n\nBeing a goth girl, Stocking takes interest in macabre and gothic aesthetics. Stocking has plushies of Jack Skellington and Oogie Boogie (both from The Nightmare Before Christmas ), Death Jr. (from the eponymous video game ), Lenore (from Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl ), Frankenweenie (from the eponymous film ), and Anabelle (from Nightmares and Fairy Tales ). In \" Bitch Perfect \", Stocking dressed up as Wednesday Addams for one of her Influenstagram posts. In \" Nothing to Room \", Stocking says that she was on the verge of writing poetry and even cutting herself because of how hungry she had gotten.",
      "Background--Description": "Taken from NewPSG.com:\n\n\"The younger sister, banished to Earth along with her sister Panty. A goth girl with straight bangs and ultra-long hair. She fights by transforming her worn stockings into two katana-shaped heavenly weapons, ＜ Stripe I & II ＞.\"\n\nStocking and her twin sister, Panty , are angels who were kicked out of Heaven for their immoral behavior; for Stocking, it was likely due to her gluttonous behavior and somewhat cynical personality. They were both sent to live at a church with Garterbelt in Daten City , a city on Earth, in order to kill ghosts . Once they earned enough Heaven Coins from the ghosts they killed, they would be able to return to Heaven. Stocking battles ghosts by transforming her stockings into katanas, named Stripes I & II .\n\nIn \" Bitch Girls: 2 Bitch \", Stocking kills Panty and cuts her into 666 pieces, revealing that she was a demon the whole time. The next episode, \" Panty and Stocking: Homecoming \", shows that Corset had simply brainwashed her into thinking she was a demon.\n\nCorset attempts to ensure that Stocking would stay evil by spawning multiple micro-Corsets, which whispered malicious thoughts in her ear. However, this backfires on Corset, as Stocking transforms into a massive ghost named Super-Sized Bitch.\n\nStocking as \"Sister Stockiel\".\n\nIn the midst of Panty and Stocking's fierce brawl, Stocking reverts back to normal. Beginning with \" Bitch Girls 4 Life \", she and Panty are forced to work with Scanty and Kneesocks to kill ghosts.\n\nAt the end of \"Heaven Wars Episode Three: Revenge Of The Bitch\" , Stocking replaces Garterbelt's role as the priestess for Junior and Bastard , after Garterbelt passed away of a heart attack.\n\nStocking is almost always seen carrying around a plush cat named Honekoneko , whose expressions and outfits often match that of Stocking. She loves Honekoneko dearly and won't let anyone else touch it.",
      "Background--Fame": "Stocking's Influenstagram page.\n\nStocking is a popular celebrity on Earth; however, she is usually overshadowed by Panty in public because of her promiscuous personality. This is shown in \" Sex and the Daten City \", when the crowd gave Stocking a subdued applause when she introduced herself at the Daten Theatre , as opposed to Panty, who received a lively round of applause.\n\nDespite this, Stocking has a large presence on the Internet, as she owns a blog and posts on social media websites such as YouTobe and Influenstagram . She is shown to have over 536,000 followers on Influenstagram.",
      "Background--Criminal Record": "Stocking's mugshot in \" Longest Bitch Yard \".\n\nStocking has been arrested in \" 1 Angry Ghost \" and \" Longest Bitch Yard \". Even though Stocking isn't as problematic as her older sister Panty she did have some crimes on her rap sheet.\n\n[ -Animal abuse\n - Stocking has stomped on, strangled, stabbed, kicked, and thrown Chuck\n countless times throughout the series.\n-Battery\n - Stocking has fought with Panty (though these were just petty squabbles) and punched Brief numerous times. She also fought with Kneesocks in \"Longest Bitch Yard\n\", though Kneesocks kicked her in the head first. During a riot in \"HELP! We are Angels\n\", Stocking bashed a fan right in the head with her guitar for climbing on the stage. In \"Shoot for Yesterday!\n\", Stocking punched Baywatcher\n, causing him to crash into a nurse's apartment and temporarily lose his memory.\n-Extortion\n - In \"Daten City President\n\", Stocking threatened to kill the President of Business\n unless he dropped out of the election. However, this can be excused because the president was a ghost.\n-Frame-up\n - In \"Bitch Girls 4 Life\n\", Stocking, along with Panty, Scanty, Kneesocks, and Garterbelt, solely blamed Brief for the fire that caused Pancake Guy\n to explode, even though Panty was largely responsible.\n-Hit and run\n - In \"Catfight Club\n\", Stocking ran over Brief and two other boys. In \"Mutant Garterbelts\n\", Stocking ran over Brief again.\n-Murder\n - Stocking has murdered many ghosts in the series, though these can be considered self-defense because the ghosts intended to harm her and others. In \"1 Angry Ghost\n\", she and Panty were put on trial for supposedly murdering an innocent ghost\n, though they were acquitted after it was later discovered that the ghost's wife\n was actually responsible. In \"Bitch Girls: 2 Bitch\n\", Stocking murdered Panty, though she only did this because she was brainwashed by Corset, which may count as coercion.\n-Red light violation\n - This is one of Stocking's charges for her arrest in \"Longest Bitch Yard\n\".\n-Vandalism\n - In \"The Stripping\n\", Panty and Stocking painted themselves on a man's car without his consent. ]",

They are known as Stripes I & II\n, and can be attached at the base of the hilt. It's safe to assume she can form other blades as well, considering the range of weaponry at Panty's disposal.

      "Trivia": "[ -Despite Garterbelt describing both Panty and Stocking as whores (or any variant of the word), the only time Stocking displays such a similar personality to Panty is in one of the manga\n, rather than in the anime.\n-Stocking's appearance and theme may be based off of Marie from Marie & Gali\n. Like Stocking, Marie is also a girl who enjoys food, has a plushie animal and wears Gothic Lolita styled clothing. She also bears a resemblance to Feli from Sega\n's Puyo Puyo\n series.\n-Stocking's age isn't specified, but it is implied in \"Catfight Club\n\" that she is over 500 years old.\n [ -However, as revealed in the Neverending Streaming\n covering the episode \"Independence Dick\n\", the Poly Brothers (this also extending to their cousins, Panty and Stocking, as well as to Scanty and Kneesocks) are \"around Brief's age\" because they \"wanted to give him similarly-aged friends\". ]\n-Stocking was originally set to have a much flatter chest and wear a tie.\n-Given how Drawn Together\n was stated to be one of the biggest inspirations for the show, particularly it's vulgarity, it may be possible that Stocking’s character was inspired by the character of Toot Braunstein. Both are gluttonous and are often depicted as the “punching bag” of fat jokes. They also wear black and white dresses and have an “old school” type of style. Toot being a parody of the rubber-hose era of animation and Stocking being a gothic Lolita as Lolita fashion is based on Victorian clothing. Stocking is also meant to be the “cuter” one of the sisters and Toot is meant to be a bit of a “cute but psycho” type of character. Although Toot is seen as frequently “ugly” and Stocking much less frequently so.\n [ -While it certainly just could be there to add to her gothic and Lolita look (or doubly add so), Stocking is the only main character to have vertical, doll-like, short more stylized eyelashes while the other main girls have horizontal and less stylized eyelashes. This specific design choice could have potentially been inspired by Toot’s own appearance. ]\n-In \"Death Race 2010\n\", Panty and Stocking's surname is revealed to be Anarchy, befitting the sisters, \"anarchy\" means \"a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority or other controlling systems.\"\n-According to the creators, Stocking is meant to be “the perfect mix of Gothic Lolita and Sweet Lolita”. Although, most people just focus on her being gothic. ]\n\nPanty and Stocking in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\n\n[ -Panty and Stocking make a cameo in the manga, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\n.\n-In the chapter, \"Killing Me Hard\n\", it is revealed that Panty and Stocking are atheists.\n-There is a scene in \"High School Nudical\n\" in which Stocking slaps several girls' breasts similarly to how Panty was slapping several boys' penises, implying that Stocking may be bisexual.\n [ -In the Manga Strip\n series, Stocking has sex with various male and female characters in different chapters, including her own sister, Panty. However, it is unknown if the Manga Strip\n series is canon to the anime. Unlike their rivals, Scanty and Kneesocks, the Anarchy sisters do not have any sort of incestuous relationship in the anime. ]\n-The girls seen in the music video for TeddyLoid\n's 2014 song, \"ME!ME!ME!\", have designs that are based off of Stocking. TeddyLoid was also the main producer for the Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt\n soundtrack\n albums\n.\n-In the Ben 10: Omniverse\n episode, \"Mystery, Incorporeal\", one of Darkstar's cultists resembles Stocking.\n-The color palette of Windblade in Transformers: Shattered Glass\n is a reference to Stocking.

      "Synopsis": "Febrie shows no fondness for Mikoto.\n\nWith the help of Saten's knowledge on how to deal with young children, the girls listen with surprise as the girl named Febrie introduces herself and mentions the name Misaka Mikoto. Saten others wonder if Mikoto knows the girl, to which Mikoto denies. After punishing Kuroko for suggesting that the girl is her daughter, Mikoto decides to introduce herself to Febrie. However, the shy girl quickly goes to Saten's side as if cautious of the girl who is just talking to her.\n\nMikoto refuses to admit defeat over a young girl, so she uses her rare pink Gekota and a hairclip to charm Febrie by making it dance using her ability. It did work, but Mikoto is shocked as Febrie quickly snatches her pink Gekota and runs away, although Kuroko easily brings her back. A disgruntled Mikoto scolds Febrie for \"stealing\" her Gekota toy, and Febrie instinctively returns to Saten's side; unfortunately, even Saten, who may already had the little girl's trust, was unable to persuade Febrie to return the Gekota toy to Mikoto.\n\nNight soon falls, and Uiharu and Kuroko decide to contact Judgment for any information about a lost child that matches Febrie's description. To their disappointment, there are no reports of missing persons that match Febrie, and Anti-Skill cannot be contacted at that time. Saten then decides to take care of the then sleeping Febrie for the meantime, putting her experience over younger siblings to good use, although she also decided to ask some assistance from Uiharu as well.\n\n[ -Mikoto tries to entertain Febrie through Gekota.\n-The girls prepare to eat dinner.\n-This \"Come hither\" look shall soon be judged.\n-...And was convicted.\n-Febrie falls into the world of dreams.\n-The lollipop is apparently an acquired taste.\n-No clue regarding Febrie. ]\n1/7\n\nThat night, Febrie gets to stay at Uiharu's place. For a moment, she remembers her friend and former roommate Haruue Erii who just left to take care of her long-lost friend Edasaki Banri, but now, Erii's spot in the bedroom is now reserved for the young girl they found earlier. As Febrie munches onto another lollipop, Uiharu and Saten assume that she is hungry, so they prepare dinner for the night, consisting of rice, meatballs, mixed vegetables and some noodles, all of which Febrie accepted heartily. Afterwards, Saten and Febrie enjoy a nice bath together while Uiharu checks up on Febrie's belongings. For a moment, Uiharu notices that her bag is filled with lollipops, and that her dress has its tag ripped away. Soon, she joins the two inside the bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile, over at the Tokiwadai Middle School Dormitory, Mikoto laments at the fact that Febrie took a member of her Gekota collection. Kuroko, however, does not see the reason to be exasperated over losing a children's toy, much to Mikoto's chagrin. Mikoto then remembers how Febrie was familiar of her name and wonders about how she learned of her name and the reason why she is scared of her. Kuroko is utterly shocked at discovering Mikoto's interest in children and decides to act like one for Mikoto's sake, but it spectacularly backfires when it awarded her with an electric shock.\n\nAs a charred Kuroko twitches on her bed, Mikoto continues thinking about how Febrie found out about her name.\n\nAt the Uiharu Residence, Saten almost dozes off while trying to read a bedtime story for Febrie as she sleeps. She did manage to wake herself up, though. Uiharu then joins her, commenting on how Febrie seemed like an oddball. Then, as Saten gazes at Febrie's cute sleeping face, she gains the curiosity to try out Febrie's lollipop.\n\nHer response, as do Uiharu, Mii, Kuroko and Mikoto's, describes the lollipop's flavor as \"intense\", to say the least.\n\nUiharu and Saten take Febrie to 177th Branch of Judgment and Uiharu and continues to look for any information regarding Febrie. Even after adding Febrie to the missing persons list, there has been no immediate responses, causing Kuroko to suspect that Febrie may be a Child Error.\n\nSoon, Erii shows up in the Judgment office after finishing preparations with her new apartment unit. The other girls soon fill her up on Febrie's current situation, and Erii shows her concern about her next place to call home, as she is anxious that not all facilities may treat her nicely as they hoped. Fortunately, Mikoto was able to ask permission fom the Tokiwadai Dormitory Supervisor to take Febrie into Asunaro Park, but the dormitory supervisor tells then that it would take five days to prepare the necessary papers for the transfer. Saten and the girls show their determination in taking care of Febrie during those five days, and Febrie is happy to hear about it, although she continues to ignore Mikoto, much to her despair.\n\nKuroko soon reminds Uiharu about the security meeting they need to attend for the upcoming Academic Assembly and the girls soon part ways with Erii, who was greeted with joy by Febrie, putting even more salt on the lonely Mikoto's wounds.\n\nAs Mii, Kuroko and Uiharu take the girls and Febrie to the venue for the security meeting, Mikoto vows to herself that she will make Febrie say her name before the end of the next five days.\n\nThe girls are not the only one looking for Febrie.\n\nThe girls arrive at one of the participating facilities for the Academic Assembly, and Saten notices that it was empty, far from what she was expecting from a widespread event in Academy City. Mii explains that it is unsurprising for someone like Saten to have this kind of impression of the Academic Assembly because it was designed for research and development instead of celebrations and having fun.\n\n[ -The Dorm supervisor agrees to the girls' suggestion.\n-Febrie enjoying the scenery.\n-Mikoto determined to have Febrie to like her.\n-Kongou blushes at being praised.\n-Kongou asks Febrie to be her friend.\n-The die is cast... Saten enacts her plan to have them bond.\n-Aiho sights a curious delivery.\n-Mikoto aside glances at the worst possible time.\n-An old face appears.\n-Febrie however is not too keen of what she discovers.\n-Febrie realizes she's alone.\n-Mikoto contacts Saten.\n-A wide-eyed teary Febrie sees Mikoto.\n-Febrie terrorized by loud security robots.\n-No match for the Railgun.\n-Febrie in the arms of Saten.\n-Febrie hugs Mikoto.\n-...Only to steal her finger toy away from her again. ]\n1/18\n\nSoon, Kongou Mitsuko, along with Awatsuki Maaya and Wannai Kinuho show up, much to Kuroko's shock. As Maaya introduces herself to Febrie, Kongou and Kinuho explain that a senior has asked for their help for the Academic Assembly, a favor Kongou quickly volunteers for. Soon, Maaya tells Kongou and Kinuho that Febrie has agreed to be friends with her, much to Mikoto's threefold despair. The three then leave shortly. Kuroko and Uiharu decide to attend the security meeting, leaving Mikoto and Saten to handle Febrie for the rest of the day. Mikoto takes this as a chance to try to win over Febrie's heart, but Saten seems to have foreseen this, so she decides to leave with Uiharu under the excuse of going to the washroom.\n\nNearby, a puzzled Yomikawa Aiho checks up on the security perimeter and laments over the large area she has to cover when two students, both operatives of Judgment, are about to receive some supplies for the upcoming event but are unauthorized to do so. As Aiho looks at some documents about the students of the school they are currently assigned at, she discovers that the school is known for their achievements in the Academic Assembly, although students of this school never show up in other venues. Soon, one of the Judgment operatives notices a man walking from a distance, although the girl was barely able to determine the identity of the unknown person.\n\nThat man was contacting someone on his phone, reporting about the delivery of certain supplies. He ends the call, but not until telling the person on the other line that he would call once again when he locks on his target.\n\nIn the school's courtyard, Mikoto finds herself struggling to interact with Febrie, who impatiently waits for Saten to return. As Mikoto ponders on her next move, Febrie impulsively follows someone wearing a Gekota suit, only to be shocked to find out that inside is a lolicon with blue hair and piercings. She soon roams around the school premises, seemingly disappointed about her meeting with the \"guy in a Gekota costume\", but soon finds out that her pink Gekota toy is missing. At that moment, the fact that she is lost dawns on Febrie.\n\nMikoto frantically searches the school perimeter in search for Febrie while holding the Gekota toy she dropped. After quickly calling her friends, they begin a tight search on their missing friend. Fortunately, she and Kongou manage to find Febrie... only to discover that there are three security robots that are speeding towards her. Mikoto quickly calls Febrie's name before leaping to her position, using her ability to hurl the robots away from Febrie.\n\nThe Railgun is relieved that Febrie, despite constantly ignoring her, is safe in the arms of Saten, who arrived shortly with Uiharu and Kuroko. Meanwhile, one more person who has shown his interest over Febrie has reported about the sighting through phone.\n\nAfter what happened earlier, Mikoto apologizes to Saten for almost losing Febrie, but Saten also says sorry for being part of the mess that had happened. Saten then asks Febrie to say sorry for worrying Mikoto a lot. Febrie goes to hug Mikoto, but she actually snatches Mikoto's pink Gekota once again. This time, however, she actually thanks Mikoto for the \"gift\". Although shocked by Febrie's quick move, Mikoto shows a smile of relief before deciding to start a game of tag with Febrie.\n\nSaten, Uiharu and Kuroko seem relieved that Mikoto has finally become friends with Febrie, while Kongou's \"contributions\" end up being treated as a joke by Kuroko, much to Kongou's frustration.\n\nElsewhere, the events that unfolded was discussed by five mysterious figures, who have commented that the opportunity to perform experiments on not only the ranked-fourth Level 5 but the ranked-third as well is—in a twisted irony—a godsend for them. Once more, a votation is opened, revealing yet another unanimous vote... this time, towards the experimentation of the Railgun, Misaka Mikoto!\n\nShunichi makes a vote for the next experiment.",

      "Biography--Plot": "Shampoo is defeated by Ranma, sparking her thirst for revenge.\n\nSoon after getting cursed at Jusenkyo , Ranma (as a girl) and Genma (as a panda) dropped into a contest in a village of the Joketsuzoku \"tribe of women heroes\" (\"Chinese Amazons\" in English versions). Half-starved, they fed on the next available food-stuff - the feast that was to be the first prize for the contest - and were instantly challenged by Shampoo, the village champion. Ranma swiftly defeated her, but this was a bad move. According to Chinese Amazon tribal laws, if a female Amazon is defeated by a female outsider, she must give the outsider the \"Kiss of Death\", hunt her down to the ends of the Earth, and kill her (as Ranma tells Akane, \"and when they say 'to the ends of Earth', they mean it\" ). Ranma and Genma managed to elude Shampoo and settled down in Nerima, thinking that they have lost her.\n\nHowever, Shampoo eventually tracked female Ranma down and resumed her attempts at murder. She found Ranma, this time a male, in the Tendo household—where she managed to enter courtesy of Kasumi Tendo , who thought Genma had invited her, when she was actually stalking him—and declares her intent to kill Akane for hiding female Ranma from her. Ranma stopped Shampoo attack by kicking the head off of her chuí, which knocked her cold when it landed on her head, accidentally defeating her a second time. However, instead of receiving a \"Kiss of Death,\" Ranma got a kiss on the lips; it turns out that if a female Amazon is defeated by a male outsider, she has to marry him. Shampoo continues on the path of trying to marry male Ranma and kill female Ranma, until Ranma tricked her into thinking that the male side is a disguise for the female side, causing her to run away heartbroken and sobbing.\n\nHeartbroken, Shampoo returned to China, where she underwent re-training at the hands of her great-grandmother Cologne and accidently received a cat curse at Jusenkyo . Realizing that Ranma had been cursed as well, Shampoo went back to Japan with Cologne to try to marry Ranma once more, learning in the process that he is actually male. Unfortunately, this revelation came at a price: Ranma has been completely \"phobic\" about cats (ailurophobic) since childhood. Nevertheless, Shampoo decided to remain near Ranma and, with her great-grandmother's help, opened the Cat Café in Furinkan .\n\nBesides Akane and Ukyo, Shampoo has managed to gain at least two strong rivals in the herbalists Pink and Link , a pair of twin sisters who live in Yakusai , a village near Joketsuzoku. The twins and Shampoo have held a grudge against each other since they were very little girls, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon. In their latest attempt at getting back at Shampoo, Pink and Link declared to Joketsuzoku’s local newspaper that Shampoo’s husband Ranma was ugly and weak; Shampoo had previously lied to the newspaper, stating that she was already married and living with Ranma.\n\nEven if she has been chased by the Ghost Cat Maomolin a couple of times, Shampoo really has only one strong suitor, her childhood friend Mousse , whom she rejected since they were both three. Cologne has stated that this holds true by Amazon law, regardless if he manages to beat Ranma, but Mousee remains stubborn despite Shampoo's multiple rejections and usual mistreatment. In Shampoo's defense, Mousse is very clingy, often trying to glomp her and will not take no for an answer. Then again, she behaves exactly the same way towards Ranma, to an even more severe degree, and has been repeatedly shown as far more inconsiderate towards him than Mousse is to her. As is standard for the series, either behavior is frequently used in a comical yet not-so-subtle-critical manner. Regardless, she occasionally shows some concern when he drives himself too far.",
      "Appearance": "Shampoo's battle outfit.\n\nShampoo has dark pink eyes and knee-length dark hair (blue/purple in the anime) with a fringe and two strands hanging in front that are secured with yellow ties. In the remake version, her pink eyes are no longer darkened and her hair is now bright purple with a white shine.\n\nShampoo in her cursed form\n\nShampoo often dresses in various forms of Chinese clothing, usually a matching blouse and pants, over which she may wear an apron while working. Her combat outfit consists of a light colored long-sleeved blouse and pants with the addition of a dark breastplate and a pair of metal arm-guards, making her one of the few characters to wear any form of armor. For formal occasions. she favors sleeveless cheongsam .\n\nShampoo's cat form is light colored with dark ears and paws, a characteristic fringe, and similar strands that frame its face. In the original anime, it has light pink fur with darker pink paws and ears.\n\nSeveral characters like Ranma and the Jusenkyo Guide has commented that Shampoo is cute. During the Phoenix Pill arc, a date with her as the prize was enough to motivate dozens of onlookers to participate in the Snowman Race. Her cat form is also considered adorable by Kasumi.",
      "Personality": "Shampoo joyfully resting in her two forms.\n\nShampoo is extremely manipulative, devious, strategic scheming, [ citation needed ] play-acting [ citation needed ] and completely ruthless behavior to advance her position towards the object of her attention. Like her great-grandmother Colgone, Shampoo does seem to enjoy having fun from the trouble she causes, particularly if it means she can get close to Ranma as a result.\n\nGiven Shampoo's violent behaviour, she views anyone who attempts to get between her and Ranma as an \"obstacle\" which must be killed. However, she has also resorted to non-lethal methods to remove an \"obstacle\", such as when she used the \"Xi Fa Xiang Gao\" to wipe Akane's memories of Ranma; until they return at which time she decides to resort to her usual violent techniques. With Shampoo's knowledge of pressure points and moxibustion , she is open to the idea of manipulating other's will to her advantage, whether that be to eliminate Akane or increasing the likelihood of Ranma returning her feelings for him.\n\nShampoo shows elements of the tsundere character, given her initially hostile temperament towards Ranma before slowly becoming more attracted to him until she finally stops her plans for revenge in favor of ensuring her marriage to Ranma. Of all the fiancées, Shampoo is the most sexually uninhibited, possibly due to her upbringing in a society including extensive warrior training for both males and females. Nudity is not a problem for her, as she rather enjoys being naked and has attempted to seduce Ranma many times, even in dangerous places like under a giant bell. Early in the series, Kasumi had a talk with her about modesty. Although Shampoo did cease her faint-inducing habit of popping out of the tub naked anytime Ranma tried to take a bath, the conversation has apparently had little effect on her behavior other than that.",
      "Abilities": "Having been trained in the martial art techniques of the Joketsuzoku since birth, with Cologne as her personal instructor and the young female village champion (probably making her the strongest member in her village after Cologne), Shampoo is an excellent armed or unarmed fighter, is very swift and acrobatic, and strong enough to casually walk right through reinforced stone walls on a regular basis. She uses a pair of chuí as her primary weapons, but is also shown using other weapons. These include a dao, spear, a bow, and a variety of polearms, including a Monk's Spade.\n\nShampoo's greatest strength may lie in sheer versatility. Beyond her fighting abilities, she has displayed knowledge of ventriloquism/voice imitation, shiatsu-induced unconsciousness, mind-control, memory loss, sleep-fighting, intuitive multi-step strategy, defense against enchanted herbs, Chinese cooking, and incredible tracking skills enabling her to hunt Ranma from rural China to the east of Japan. She even has access to minor magic equipment - the Instant Jusenkyo , the Love Pill Bracelet , the Waterproof Soap , the Kairaishi Mushroom and the Reversal Jewel being major examples - and is capable of using her bike to literally bounce across the city.\n\nShampoo is noted to be a competent fighter by many other characters, and has joined Ranma against many opponents such as Taro and the Phoenix tribe . Shampoo's most impressive moment in the manga came when she was freed from Kiema 's enslavement, and was intent to let her captor \"suffer a thousand deaths\". She managed to hold her own against the Phoenix tribe captain, although, in the one full page dedicated to their battle, Kiima was shown as mostly interested in freeing the Kinjakan to assist her lord Saffron in his confrontation with Ranma. They are later shown as completely focused on watching the fight, with Kiima caught in Shampoo's headlock. In the anime, a similar fight occurred with Mon Lon in the movie \" Big Trouble in Nekonron, China \"; shortly afterwards Mon Lon was incapacitated in the arms of Mousse, who believed her to be Shampoo, while Shampoo is shown to be okay.\n\nIn the Shonen Sunday Wide-ban edition of the manga, Shampoo's end-of-series stats are shown to be lower than Ranma, comparable to Ryoga, and above Mousse, Ukyo, Akane and Kodachi. Her top stats are heart and technique, and she has shown being faster than Mousse. It can be difficult to compare her with Tatewaki Kuno , as the latter can either pose a challenge for Ranma, with powerful air-pressure swipes, be treated as a 1-hit joke, an even match for his sister Kodachi , or even as vastly superior to his nemesis.\n\nShampoo has scared Ranma while she was still attempting to kill him in her female form. However, Shampoo is still outclassed by Ranma however, and was swiftly overpowered the first few times she has seriously faced him in combat. She suffered a 1-hit loss during her village's martial arts competition, where the goal was to knock the opponent off the log they were standing on, and an accidental identical result when focused on killing Akane, both times before she was powered-up by Cologne. After Ranma lied to Shampoo that she was a girl all along, Shampoo made a strike at female Ranma, but his hand was positioned to block it, and Shampoo stopped herself before delivering it. In the original anime continuity Shampoo actually seemed to overpower female Ranma, attacking more aggressively using her chuí, and he tripped while dodging her attacks and was left on the ground seemingly helpless. Fortunately, Shampoo was unwilling to land the blow and stopped her attack. During the \"Reversal Jewel\" arc, Shampoo was again outmatched by female Ranma in unarmed combat, despite his holding back by only using restraining tactics, and her cursed 'programming' to truly hate him. It is noteworthy that Shampoo did manage better against Ranma when armed with her signature weapons in the final arc, but female Ranma also held back by sticking to defensive/restraining regular fighting, due to Shampoo being brainwashed. We don't even see them fight one on one for very long, as Mousse in duck form ambushed Shampoo with weapons, and she eventually used an imprinting egg on Genma after recovering.\n\nNotably, Mousse has displayed vastly superior mettle in several of his battles with Ranma, although this has gained him very limited respect. Though mettle in part could be a factor, it is likely that Shampoo was simply less durable than Mousse earlier on, akin to a glass cannon (albeit still more resilient than Akane at the start of the series), rather than being weaker than Mousee in general. The Shonen Sunday Wide-ban edition of the manga shows Shampoo noticeably higher in the listed categories Mousse isn't almost at or equal in.\n\nThe main constant rival of Shampoo is Akane, the only fiancé of Ranma he accepted. Shampoo has been explicitly shown as stronger and faster than Akane early in the series. During their first duel, Shampoo effortlessly dodged Akane's kick and knocked her out with the Hissatsu Shiatsuken. Later on, Shampoo managed to stand up to Akane's strength to an extent even after she had eaten Super Soba , despite not being aware of this fact. When Shampoo ate some Super Soba of her own, the two seemed more evenly matched, but Shampoo did not have much time to challenge Akane in either case before Ranma tricked her into eating the antidote. In the early manga, at the start of the Martial Arts Takeout race, Shampoo casually deflected a flurry of daggers thrown at Akane's back while she was serving customers by flinging the bowl of ramen straight into the air and using her serving tray to reflect the daggers back and pin the customers that Cologne was trying to impress to the wall without hurting them. Shampoo did this feat without looking back or moving anything other than her arms, caught the thrown bowl of ramen without spilling a drop, and was neither surprised nor strained by this exertion. By comparison, Akane would not receive a similar feat - deflecting and/or dodging a barrage of arrows fired from the front - until the second-last story of the manga.\n\nShampoo's only shown skirmish with her other rival Ukyo (beyond a couple of brief, or off-screen free-for-all gang-ups against Ranma, Hinako, or Genma) happened during the onsen race, and consisted of Shampoo being kept busy deflecting Ukyo mini-spatulas, while their feet were tied to Ranma and Ryoga's respectively, but Ukyo didn't use her more powerful special techniques, and also managed to hold her own against Ranma for a much longer time during their initial conflict. Ukyo's better performance is at least partially due to being surrounded by a hot grill and that Ranma initially held back, but she also managed to avoid two of his attacks and strike him with a flour bomb when this was no longer the case, as well as fight and parry with Ryoga for a brief time before being overcome. In the end there has been no clear-cut contest of relative skill between the two in the manga. In the anime continuity their comparative ability is more clearly displayed. In \"Ranma the Lady-Killer\" they are both exhausted after a duel that has gone on for hours. Shampoo was not shown using her chuí, and Ukyo not shown employing her superior range of special techniques. While Ukyo is distracted by talking to Ranma just as the fight resumes, Shampoo uses the moment to sucker-attack Ukyo with a barrage of thrown forks, pinning her to a tree.\n\nIn the arc with Pink and Link, despite letting her guard down a few times and landing herself in trouble, when Shampoo is focused on the pair she makes a much quicker work of them than Ranma. This results in Pink and Link being genuinely terrified of her, but relatively indifferent to Ranma to the point of not respecting him as a figher. WIth Pink and Link, Shampoo seems to take a similar brute force approach she took on earlier with Ranma, suggesting that part of her issues with fighting her beloved Ranma may be in approach just like Ranma is hesitant to fight against Akane due to his romantic feelings for the only fiancé he acknowledged, though he still seems a superior fighter than Shampoo overall. Interestingly, Shampoo seems to be a much more brutal fighter while unconcious and unable to hold back, implying she tends to not go all out in a typical fight.",
      "Abilities--Techniques--Combat-oritented moves": "[ -Hissatsu Shiatsuken\n(必殺指圧拳 ,  Xi Fa Xiang Gao\n? ) : An attack using a specially devised herbal shampoo in conjunction with a shiatsu massage technique involving pressure points on the head to erase her opponent's memories. The process takes at most 6 seconds.\n-Remote Control Acupressure\n: Activated by pressing both fingers against an unprepared target's temples. Afterwards the victim is susceptible to a brief mind-control effect. Used to turn a distracted Akane unconscious during the 'waterproof soap' story, when Shampoo made Akane put herself in harm's way by standing in front of a roller coaster, then affectionately hug Ryoga and finally urge him to give back Shampoo the waterproof soap.\n-Sleep fighting\n: Used against Pink and Link after being bitten by the Poisonous-Snake Plant. Although someone bitten by the plan will fall into a deep sleep which needs an antidote to awaken from, Shampoo's hatred of the twins was so strong that she nearly killed the two even while asleep before eventually succumbing to the plant's poison.\n-Kakato Otoshi:\n A jumps on someone's head to get a boost, used on Akane\n. Named in Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle\n.\n-Dumpling\n Bombs\n: Similar to Ukyo's okonomiyaki\n bombs, but smaller. Only used in the final wedding story.\n-Fork Darts\n (Anime): Similar to Ukyo's spatula shuriken. ]",
      "Abilities--Techniques--Less combat-orientated moves:": "[ -Voice Imitation\n: Another 'secret soap' technique. Shampoo perfectly imitated Akane's tone of voice, but it is unclear if she used ventriloquism or not given that she crouched behind her rival.\n-Chow Mein Strike\n: The user turns a bowl-full of ramen noodles into a whip, forcing the intended food recipient to eat his way out during take-out competitions. Given its limited tensile strength it's likely not useful beyond this function.\n-Delivery Box Blow-out\n (also known as the Box-Blower Blow): A move from the school of 'Martial Arts Takeout,' a style in which Cologne has stated that Shampoo is 'not half bad.' This allows the user to instantly 'overcook' the food contained within a delivery box with a finger or pointed hand strike. It may have had a similar effect when Shampoo accidentally struck a water tower instead, although more likely it simply burst after being slightly cracked. This technique only appears in Shampoo's arsenal in the manga; in the anime it is the property of Kaori Daikoku\n. ]",
      "Relationships--Family": "Cologne\n\nCologne talks to Shampoo\n\nShampoo and her great-grandmother Cologne have a very close familiar relationship. Cologne has raised and trained Shampoo from a young age, and is openly proud of her martial arts student and great-grandaughter. While Cologne made severe mistakes towards Shampoo like choosing Jusenkyo as a training spot, they usually get along rather well, to the point that Cologne followed Shampoo to Japan in hopes of the younger woman marrying Ranma. Upon their arrival, Cologne not only opened a restaurant to ensure their joint livehood, but also supported the schemes of her great-grandaugher and tested the skills of her \"son-in-law\". Both Cologne and Shampoo have similar personality traits, most notably their enjoyment for the chaos their presence brings, for better and worse.",
      "Relationships--Romances": "Mousse\n\nMain article: Mousse-Shampoo Relationship\n\nMousse and Shampoo hanging out\n\nPossibly Shampoo's most prominent relationship besides her familiar bond with Cologne, Shampoo and Mousse have been childhood friends. Shampoo generally acts rather cold towards Mousse, but does have her moments where she is nice to him. Mousse, on the other hand. is in love with Shampoo and desperately seeks her attention, despite her being after Ranma.\n\nShampoo's desire for a man who can sweep her off her feet suggests that she might downplay her own strength either subconsciously or intentionally, perhaps to indulge in the fantasy of being rescued. This inclination is evident in her attempt to coerce Pink and Link into creating a scenario for Ranma to come to her rescue, though the outcome is far from successful. Furthermore, her apparent disinterest in Mousse may not solely be attributed to his submissiveness or underhandedness but could also stem from his inability to fully match her combat abilities.\n\nEarly in the manga, Shampoo sabotaged Mousse's romantic efforts many times and stated outright that she hates Mousse , claiming in the closing chapter that he makes her sick, and that that she would like to personally kill him for his \"foolish behavior\" and \"ruining her happiness\". However, there have been a few hints that her feelings for her childhood 'friend' are not restricted to contempt, loathing and annoyance. Nevertheless, it always takes extreme circumstances for her to give him any leeway whatsoever since she generally harshly rejects, and treats him in a very cold manner. For example, she cheerfully repeatedly threw bombs at him (which are non lethal by Ranmaverse standards) during a duel with Ranma, since she didn't wish to give him a promised date if he either managed to prevail, or Ranma lost on purpose. While she temporarily felt bad about it and cradled his beaten duck form afterward, she quickly got over it, tying him with a chain to the neck, and taunted him by holding his food out of reach. When she found his duck form beaten (by Taro) on the street, she didn't bother to brake and casually ran over him, but seemed somewhat concerned or at least curious afterwords. After Ranma pinned Mousse's duck form to a wall and said 'If you weren't such a moron I wouldn't have Shampoo pestering me all the time,' she did turn into a cat and began to chase Ranma, but not to save Mousse, but because she was maddened by the statement. She didn't care when he was to leave for China at first, but she was glad when he returned and even had a feast prepared for him. (though these actions are possibly cause her and Cologne needed to go away for a while and have someone watch the restaurant.)\n\nBy the later part of the manga, there are hints Shampoo may be softening her stance towards Mousse.  When love has been turned to hate by the Reverse Jewel, Mousse decided to take advantage to approach an affected Shampoo, who rejected and beat him in the normal manner, which may hint that her feelings towards him contain elements of both derision and appreciation. Cologne even commented that \"It seems as if Shampoo does not hate you as much as before\". She later agreed to go on a date with Mousse after he eventually abstained from using magic apology-inducing glasses during his duels with Ranma, while the other man retaliated by using any petty cheats available. Unfortunately for Mousse, the goodwill he earned by appearing in a better light than his rival was eradicated when he took Shampoo to a zombie-demon show, which she found disgusting and not romantic in the least. Later, when Mousse was almost drained of life while enchanted into dating a magic Jizo statue he believed was Shampoo, she initially didn't care at all and stayed home to play video games instead. Eventually, she reluctantly gave him a scarf she was making for Ranma to wake him from the trance. After Mousse decided to free Shampoo from Kiima's slavery instead of taking advantage, she didn't feel the least inclination of gratitude, or even spared him a moment's thought, but rather immediately took the opportunity to hug Ranma instead. That said, she shouldn't feel in debt for not being enslaved by him, though. And a few chapters later anyway, when Mousse pointed out that his heart has been true to HER all this time and there's nothing more she can do about Ranma since he is marrying Akane soon, Shampoo begrudgingly agreed with him and then asked Mousse to make celebratory meat buns with her for Ranma's and Akane's wedding. However, she soon succumbed to her old habit of trying to break Ranma and Akane up again\n\nIn the separate anime continuity there are occasional hints that Shampoo actually does hold some love for Mousee, despite vehemently professing the contrary. In the later part of the series Shampoo was the one who convinced him to stay in Japan rather than go back to China, and she cradled him in her arms when he saved her life but was almost killed in the 'Nihao, My Concubine' movie. In the first example, though, she and Cologne explicitly did so because they decided to go to a hot springs and wanted somebody to watch the shop, and knew that Mousse was still available and would do it for free. In the second example, Shampoo is shown relaxing while Mousse is being forced to do heavy labor in the background in the ending credits.\n\nRanma Saotome\n\nMain article: Ranma-Shampoo Relationship\n\nShampoo being smitten with Ranma.\n\nBecause of her traditions and Ranma defeating her (accidentally) in his male form, it is law that she marry him, and she tries everything possible to accomplish that. Frequently, she glomps Ranma on sight and asks for a date, much to his chagrin. She is not above using trickery and magic to get Ranma to fall in love with her. When Ranma was first hugged by Shampoo, he blushed and thought to himself that she was cute. He seems to have a good degree of friendship with her, going to the Cat Cafe for free bowls of ramen and helping Mousse to rescue her when she's held captive by Maomolin. However, unlike Ukyo, who Ranma at least considers as a regular, non-romantic old friend, he has stated outright that he views Shampoo. Regardless, his attitude towards both of them seems conflicted between consideration for their feelings. He was moved by Shampoo's tears when she believed that he rejected her during the onsen race, and had a similar problem with Ukyo during the 'Secret Sauce' arc. His pride took it as a direct challenge to win back Shampoo's affections during the 'Reversal Jewel' storyline, where he also forces a confession out of Ukyo to feel desirable again. His only attempt to directly get rid of Shampoo (beyond encouraging Mousse in his efforts) happened during her first appearance. Ranma is also noticably put off by Mousse considering using the imprinting eggs to make Shampoo his girlfriend as shown in Chapter 398 , but that might out of empathy since Ranma has experienced harassment by men in his female form quite often. Like most cute girls in the series, she can usually manipulate him by feigning tears. If that fails, Shampoo can sometimes get Ranma to bend to her will by transforming into her cat form and taking advantage of his fear -  she usually performs this stunt when he makes her angry.",
      "Relationships--Friendships": "Akane Tendo\n\nShampoo first saw Akane as an obstacle for Ranma's affection, and has tried to kill or do away with her on more then one occasion, but after relocating permanently to Furinkan, changes her view on Akane. In a sense, they have a similar relationship to Ranma's and Ryoga's, being fierce rivals and battling on occasion, yet considering each other close friends, and saving each other on a basis, such as when Akane helped Mousse and Ranma free Shampoo from Maomolin, or when Shampoo helped to rescue Akane when she was kidnapped by Kirin of the Seven Lucky Gods. This doesn't stop Akane from being irritated when Shampoo tackle glomps Ranma, nor does it stop Shampoo in the pursuit of her airen.\n\nUkyo Kuonji\n\nShampoo and Ukyo have a complex relationship. While the two are rivals for Ranma's affections, and rivals in the food business, they can occasionally get along. Other times, they usually trade snide remarks. Their rivalry can be displayed not just in their fighting but in their cooking, when Ukyo accidentally ruined Shampoo's ramen by getting okonomiyaki sauce in it, but only sarcastically apologized, which led to Shampoo pouring it onto Ukyo's cooking.\n\nRyoga Hibiki\n\nShampoo initially did not acknowledge Ryoga as anyone significant, as at the time, she was hellbent on killing Ranma's female side. Ryoga didn't seem to think much of her either initially. He soon came to fear her after she attempted to serve him (in his pig form) as a dish to Ranma and kicked him in the head during her fight with Akane. Of course, Shampoo didn't know of his Jusenkyo curse at the time. After her relocation, she tends to hang out with Ryoga (along with Mousse, Ranma, and the others) and is shown to have a degree of friendship. This didn't stop her from trying to steal back her waterproof soap when it ended up in his hands.",
      "Quotes": "To be added",
      "Non-canon appearances": "Shampoo has been a staple character in the most of the video games and a playable character in the fighting games. She  made several cameos in Kappa Mikey in crowd scenes, usually dancing, and also appears briefly in the opening theme.",
      "Trivia": "Mimi and Nene.\n\n[ -As with her fellow Joketsuzoku\n, Cologne\n and Mousse\n, the gag in Shampoo's name is that the romanization of her name - Shān Pú\n or Shānpú\n - sounds like a beauty product in English. Uniquely amongst the Joketsuzoku, Shampoo's name can be written with either of two pairings of kanji/hanzi that share the same pronunciation. The first set of kanji/hanzi that can be used to write Shān Pú\n are the characters for \"Coral\" (Shān\n) and \"Uncut Gem\" (Pú\n). The second set uses the characters \"Mountain(-like)\" (Shān\n) and \"Chest\" (Pú\n).\n-Shampoo's hair color in the anime adaptation can vary depending on episode. The vast majority of her episodes depict her with dark blue hair, but the OAVs and Movies, as well as certain episodes, show her with dark purple hair. Oddly, Shampoo is depicted with green hair in the first opening of the series.\n-Fans of the series often mistakenly refer to Shampoo's weapons as bonbori\n, which is incorrect: bonbori are a spherical shaped paper lantern that are hung outside in Japan, which her weapons do resemble. The english manual for Ranma ½: Hard Battle\n mistakenly refers to them as \"lanterns.\" Her weapons are actually a pair of chuí\n. Chuí are maces with a large spherical head made out of solid iron or bronze, as such they are extremely heavy and cannot be used by most people.\n-A fundamental quirk of Shampoo's character is that she does not have a native speaker's affinity for Japanese, and how this is portrayed varies depending on the language into which the series has been dubbed. In the original Japanese, and in its Chinese translation, Shampoo speaks in an archaically formal manner. In the English, she uses a form of \"broken English\", referring to herself in the third person and utilizing a minimalistic dialogue that emphasizes nouns and verbs whilst omitting prepositions, indefinite articles and definite articles.\n-The manga has a running gag of Shampoo making her entrance by running over people, mainly Ranma, with her bicycle. This also appears on a few occasions in the anime, but is usually directed against other people and only appears roughly half a dozen times in all of the anime episodes and specials.\n-Shampoo's mother is never shown during the series. Her father appears several times in cameos in the manga but never in the anime.\n-Shampoo's seiyū provided the voice of Masato's Mother\n of the Rumiko Takahashi Theater: Mermaid's Forest\n.\n-Shampoo's English voice actress would provide the voices of the Mama Higurashi\n and Urasue\n on Inuyasha\n.\n-Shampoo seems to have been designed as a reference to the female protagonist Lum\n from Takahashi's earlier comedy series Urusei Yatsura\n. Both characters are exotic \"foreigner\" girls characterized as being highly loving and affectionate, but also temperamental, violent, scheming and jealously possessive, with an imperfect understanding of proper Japanese behaviors.\n-Shampoo seems to be the inspiration for several female characters who have appeared in other anime.\n [ -One episode of Slayers NEXT\n features the traveling twin martial artists Mimi and Nene\n, aspiring idol singers whom Lina encounters during a search for a magical ritual whose origins she has misunderstood. The twins are clearly based on Shampoo in terms of their designs, sharing her odango hairstyle, wearing qipao, and having purple colored hair similar to Shampoo, as well as having her affinity for martial arts in a series where swordplay and sorcery are the normal means of combat.\n-Renka Ma\n from History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi\n is another apparent homage to Shampoo; like Shampoo, she is a very beautiful female martial artist from China with exotic purple hair and superhuman physical abilities who acts as a rival to the female protagonist Miu Fūrinji\n for the love of the male protagonist, Kenichi Shirahama\n. Renka's tendency to act with feline mannerisms, and her cat-themed hairstyle, acts as an homage to Shampoo's transforming into a cat due to her Jusenkyo\n curse. ]\n-Her English Voice Actress in the 2024 series Grace Lu Mentioned on Instagram her love the of the 1989 series ]",

      "Appearance": "Yoo Joonghyuk is repeatedly described as extremely handsome by various individuals, including the author of Ways of Survival and Kim Dokja . The latter even uses him as a measurement for others' handsomeness on multiple occasions.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk has wide black eyes with thin double eyelids and thick eyebrows. His right eye glows golden upon activation of the skill [Sage's Eye]. His hair is black and slightly wavy, cut short. He has tan skin, a sharp nose ridge, and a strong jawline. He is extremely muscular; in particular, he has well-toned biceps and thighs.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk usually wears a black coat and combat boots. Under the jacket, covers for the novel have shown him to wear a black shirt with a silver collar and buckle, along with close-fitting black pants. He is also depicted as having at least one belt across his chest, along with a sword scabbard worn at his waist, held on by straps attached to his belt and around his thigh.\n\nIn his female form, under the pseudonym \"Punisher\", Yoo Joonghyuk has waist-length hair and deep, sultry eyes beneath neat eyebrows. He is, according to Kim Dokja, thrice as beautiful in his Punisher form than his male form. He is smaller and sleeker than usual in this form, and wears a black cape to cover hide his distinctive clothing.\n\nWhen acting as Zhu Bajie during the reenactment of Journey to the West, he wears a half-open black vest and tight black jeans.",
      "Personality": "Yoo Joonghyuk was designed as someone 'tougher in body and nobler in heart than any creature in this world'. He is resolute and determined, aiming to accomplish his goals no matter the cost, in particular when aiming for the end of the scenarios. As a protagonist, Yoo Joonghyuk naturally fights for the greater good. He was originally a caring person at heart, doing good where he could, but repeated regressions have worn him down to the point where, in his 1863 rd round, he commits enough sins to make him a prime target of the Absolute Good constellations.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk is normally very confident in his abilities, never backing down from a challenge and typically cutting down his enemies with ease. He is extremely talented in various areas, befitting of his status as a protagonist. He takes pride in his own skill, sometimes to the point of not perceiving anyone else's work as good, as seen when he will eat no one's cooking but his own. Yoo Joonghyuk is smart and strategic; this helps him learn new skills and figure out plans to subvert the scenarios. However, he can also struggle to adapt his strategies and see things from new perspectives. This is a major reason as to why he took 1863 rounds to even get close to the Final Wall; he would struggle to change his strategies and adapt to new situations, easily failing and having to regress.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk's speech is concise and blunt, often to the point of rudeness. He becomes explicitly rude and threatening when speaking to individuals who irritate him, or who are powerful unknowns. He is sometimes also rude to his own party members, though he looks out for them nonetheless, showing that he cares despite his harshness. Frequently, he expresses himself through actions or expressions rather than words. These include habits such as dragging the tip of his sword along the ground when happy, or his left eyebrow twitching upon making an serious decision. On rare occasions, however, he can be very eloquent and persuasive.\n\nOver the course of his regressions, aside from becoming more open to cruelty, he becomes extremely calculating and cold. He kills those he deems threats and supports those who he believes can aid him. He distances himself even from his own companions; in the 41 st round, when his core party members die, he only laments that they are no longer useful. However, this is most likely a tactic to try and minimize the hurt of losing them, as even further regressions show him warming back up to them, selflessly sacrificing himself for them over and over; which is most evidently referenced and shown in his 999th regression.\n\nThe trauma he experiences over his regressions result in Yoo Joonghyuk having a tendency to fall into \"regression depression\", where he easily loses hope on even small failures, and considers giving up and regressing so that he can try again next round. The further into his regressions he is, the stronger the effect of regression depression, until in his 1863 rd round, it causes him to fall into a dissociative state where he is completely unresponsive.",
      "Quotes": "[ -\"He is my companion.\" ]\n\n{\"There also were a lot of important information which was automatically filtered from the beginning.\"This article contains hidden, major spoilers for later sections of the story. Continue at your own risk. | Show Spoilers\n\nHide Spoilers}\n\n[ -\"Tell me, you fool. If I continue to regress, will I ever get to meet you again?\"\n-\"I give you my word. I will definitely return.\" (To Yoo Mia)\n-\"There is only my birthday in this life.\" (Yoo Joonghyuk of the 4th regression, in the first text revision of Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World\n)\n-\"The one who can save the world... It might be you, not me.\"\n-\"I won't give up on this life. So don't give up either.\" ]",
      "Trivia": "[ -Kim Dokja often refers to Yoo Joonghyuk as a sunfish. This is a reference to the game \"Survive! Mola Mola\" (mola mola is another name for a sunfish). In the game, you have to keep a sunfish alive and escape the dangers of the sea. However, the sunfish dies because of almost anything and one must start over many times in order to get anywhere; this parallels how Yoo Joonghyuk needed over a thousand rounds in order to even approach a conclusive end to the scenarios, and how he died very easily particularly in the early rounds.\n-He dislikes the color white.\n-Taking the year that ORV started (2018) to be the same calendar year in-text at the start of the novel, and assuming that all ages are given according to the Korean system, Yoo Joonghyuk's date of birth is August 3, 1991.\n-His favorite food is murim dumplings.\n-His eyesight is the best out of every member of Kim Dokja's Company.\n-Yoo Joongyuk is not bad at singing, but he is tone deaf and doesn't realize it.\n-Due to coming into existence as an adult, Yoo Joonghyuk never attended high school, however, if he ever were a high school student he would be uninterested in studying but attend classes faithfully. He would like playing games after school and often get confessed to by female students because of his good looks, however he would not be interested in dating.\n-After the group regression came back, Yoo Joonghyuk tried to get back into pro-gaming but ended up quitting.\n-If the events of ORV never happened and Yoo Joonghyuk retired from pro-gaming, he would have went on to become an actor or model. He might have also become the lead actor in a movie adaptation of one of Han Sooyoung's novels.\n-Due to his lack of childhood memories, Yoo Joonghyuk did not know his birthday. Namgung Minyoung was the one to give him the date August 3rd.\n-Yoo Joonghyuk is represented as wolf multiple times throughout the story and it is his official animal counterpart. Several merch pieces in the Taiwanese version feature him with wolf ears and tail. ]",
      "Trivia--Translation": "[ -Yoo Joonghyuk's name has been a source of some contention.\n [ -The hangul is most directly transliterated as \"Yoo Joonghyeok\". The \"oo\" in Yoo\n and Joo\nnghyuk are functionally the same sound, which is why the spelling Yoo Joonghyuk is the one favored on this wiki. The \"eo\" sound is also often transliterated as \"u\" in English, hence the change from Joonghyeo\nk to Joonghyu\nk. This \"eo\" → \"u\" change can also be seen in other names, such as Lee Hyu\nnsu\nng's and Ju\nng Heewon's.\n-However, the first translator\n used to spell it Yoo Jonghyuk (with only one O in his given name). They have since stated that this was an error, and if possible they'd want to change it.\n-The second translator\n changed it to the more accurate Yu Jung-Hyeok, but did not use the \"eo\" → \"u\" method, using \"oo\" → \"u\" instead and leaving \"eo\" as is. This was done to keep to the Revised Romanization\n standards, the current official romanization system in South Korea.\n-The spelling used in official English translations is Yu Junghyeok/Junghyeok Yu. ] ]"
